Audio signal processing is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signal s .
Processing methods and application areas include storage , data compression , music information retrieval , speech processing , localization , acoustic detection , transmission , noise cancellation , acoustic fingerprinting , sound recognition , synthesis , and enhancement ( e.g. equalization , filtering , level compression , echo and reverb removal or addition , etc .
Audio synthesis is also used to generate human speech using speech synthesis .
It is often used in signal processing for analyzing functions or series of values , such as time domain signals .
In signal processing , the above definition is often used without the normalization , that is , without subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance .
Britain usually refers to the United Kingdom , a sovereign state comprising the island of Great Britain , the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands .

" Blade Runner " has numerous similarities to Fritz Lang ' s " Metropolis " , including a built-up urban environment , in which the wealthy literally live above the workers , dominated by a huge building - the Stadtkrone Tower in " Metropolis " and the Tyrell Building in " Blade Runner " .
Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1982 for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts and Golden Globe as best original score , and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film , the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade .
Denis Villeneuve , who directed the sequel , " Blade Runner 2049 " , cites the film as a huge influence for him and many others .
" Blade Runner " is cited as a major influence on Warren Spector ,
The film 's art designer Syd Mead praised the truck and said he was " flattered " by the homage to Blade Runner .
The PC game featured a non-linear plot , non-player character s that each ran in their own independent Artificial intelligence , and an unusual pseudo-3D engine ( which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements ) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game .
A direct sequel was released in 2017 , titled " Blade Runner 2049 " , with Ryan Gosling in the starring role .
Dick 's friend K. W. Jeter wrote three authorized " Blade Runner " novels that continue Rick Deckard 's story , attempting to resolve the differences between the film and " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?

" Cinescape " , September / October 1998 issue A bonus feature on the Blu-ray for " Prometheus " , the 2012 film by Scott set in the " Alien " universe , states that Eldon Tyrell , CEO of the " Blade Runner " Tyrell Corporation , was the mentor of Guy Pearce ' s character Peter Weyland .
Bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields , including electronics , information theory , digital communication s , radio communication s , signal processing , and spectroscopy and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel .
The bilinear transform ( also known as Tustin ' s method ) is used in digital signal processing and discrete-time control theory to transform continuous-time system representations to discrete-time and vice versa .
In information theory and computer science , a code is usually considered as an algorithm that uniquely represents symbols from some source alphabet , by " encoded " strings , which may be in some other target alphabet .
In general , computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists , computer science , experts in artificial intelligence , mathematicians , logic ians , philosophers , cognitive scientists , cognitive psychologists , psycholinguists , anthropologists and neuroscientists , among others .
The Association for Computational Linguistics defines computational linguistics as :
When machine translation ( also known as mechanical translation ) failed to yield accurate translations right away , automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed .
The term " computational linguistics " itself was first coined by David Hays , a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics ( ICCL ) .
In a now famous paper published in 1950 Alan Turing proposed the possibility that machines might one day have the ability to " think .
This work takes a computational approach via parameter estimation models to categorize the vast array of linguistic styles we see across individuals and simplify it for a computer to work in the same way , making human-computer interaction much more natural .
These systems , such as Siri of the iOS operating system , operate on a similar pattern-recognizing technique as that of text-based systems , but with the former , the user input is conducted through speech recognition .
With the proliferation of the internet and the abundance of easily accessible written human language , the ability to create a program capable of natural language understanding would have many broad and exciting possibilities , including improved search engines , automated customer service , and online education .
In 1971 Terry Winograd developed an early natural language processing engine capable of interpreting naturally written commands within a simple rule-governed environment .
These kinds of problems are referred to as question answering .
Examples include speech recognition software , such as Apple 's Siri feature , spellcheck tools , speech synthesis programs , which are often used to demonstrate pronunciation or help the disabled , and machine translation programs and websites , such as Google Translate .
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed , whether spoken or textual ; and upon the task being performed , whether analyzing language ( recognition ) or natural language generation .
Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers .
Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language , perception , memory , attention , reasoning , and emotion ; to understand these faculties , cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics , psychology , artificial intelligence , philosophy , neuroscience , and anthropology .
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields , including psychology , neuroscience , linguistics , philosophy of mind , computer science , anthropology and biology .
In the area of language acquisition , for example , some ( such as Steven Pinker ) have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes , whereas others ( such as Jeffrey Elman and colleagues in Rethinking Innateness ) have argued that Pinker 's claims are biologically unrealistic .
As the field is highly interdisciplinary , research often cuts across multiple areas of study , drawing on research methods from psychology , neuroscience , computer science and systems theory .
It has also given rise to a new theory of the philosophy of mathematics , and many theories of artificial intelligence , persuasion and coercion .
Kurt GÃ¶del , Alonzo Church , Alan Turing , and John von Neumann were instrumental in these developments .
The term " cognitive science " was coined by Christopher Longuet-Higgins in his 1973 commentary on the Lighthill report , which concerned the then-current state of Artificial Intelligence research .
In the 1970s and early 1980s , as access to computers increased , artificial intelligence research expanded .
Researchers such as Marvin Minsky would write computer programs in languages such as LISP to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through , for instance , in making decisions and solving problems , in the hope of better understanding human thought , and also in the hope of creating artificial minds .
In artificial intelligence , Marvin Minsky , Herbert A. Simon , and Allen Newell are prominent .
Popular names in the discipline of psychology include George A. Miller , James McClelland , Philip Johnson-Laird , and Steven Pinker .
In 1998 , CCS was incorporated into the University of Edinburgh 's University of Edinburgh School of Informatics .
Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them .
) by the International Commission on Illumination .
Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength ( or frequency ) and its intensity .
In 1931 , an international group of experts known as the " Commission internationale de l 'Ã©clairage " ( International Commission on Illumination ) developed a mathematical color model , which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each .
The ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelength s .
The International Commission on Illumination chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut .
Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines , formed of one or more parallel thin layers , or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color 's wavelength .
Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring , Image processing , analyzing and understanding digital images , and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information , e.g. in the forms of decisions .
Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction , event detection , video tracking , object recognition , 3D pose estimation , learning , indexing , motion estimation , visual servoing , 3D scene modeling , and image restoration .
In the late 1960s , computer vision began at universities which were pioneering artificial intelligence .
Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithm s that exist today , including extraction of edges from images , labeling of lines , non-polyhedral and polyhedral modeling , representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures , optical flow , and motion estimation .
At the same time , variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation .
Areas of artificial intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment .
Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as pattern recognition and learning techniques .
Computer vision is often considered to be part of information engineering .
Also , some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision ( " e.g. " neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification ) have their background in biology .
Yet another field related to computer vision is signal processing .
The fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing , image analysis and machine vision .
Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring , Image processing , analyzing and understanding digital images , and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information , " e.g. " , in the forms of decisions .
Currently , the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural network s .
An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection , with millions of images and hundreds of object classes .

While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second , advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high-speed image acquisition , processing , and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second .
Steven Sasson , an electrical engineer working for Kodak , invented the first digital still camera using a Fairchild
In January 2006 , Boyle and Smith were awarded the National Academy of Engineering Charles Stark Draper Prize , for their invention of the CCD concept .
James M. Early developed a vertical anti-blooming drain that would not detract from the light collection area , and so did not reduce light sensitivity .
Cyc ( pronounced ) is a long-living artificial intelligence project that aims to assemble a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that spans the basic concepts and rules about how the world works .
Douglas Lenat began the project in July 1984 at MCC , where he was Principal Scientist 1984-1994 , and then , since January 1995 , has been under active development by the Cycorp company , where he is the CEO .
Douglas Lenat and Alan Kay publicized this need , and they organized a meeting at Stanford in 1983 to address the problem .
The back-of-the-envelope calculations by Doug , Alan , and their colleagues ( including Marvin Minsky , Allen Newell , Edward Feigenbaum , and John McCarthy ) indicated that that effort would require between 1000 and 3000 person-years of effort , far beyond the standard academic project model .
Increasingly , however , work at Cycorp involves giving the Cyc system the ability to communicate with end users in natural language , and to assist with the ongoing knowledge formation process via machine learning and natural language understanding .
) In addition to the taxonomic information contained in OpenCyc , ResearchCyc includes significantly more semantic knowledge ( i.e. , additional facts and rules of thumb ) involving the concepts in its knowledge base ; it also includes a large lexicon , English parsing and generation tools , and Java based interfaces for knowledge editing and querying .
The Cleveland Clinic has used Cyc to develop a natural language query interface of biomedical information , spanning decades of information on cardiothoracic surgeries .
A similar sentiment was expressed by Marvin Minsky : " Unfortunately , the strategies most popular among AI researchers in the 1980s have come to a dead end , " said Minsky .
Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the cofounder of an AI company called Geometric Intelligence , says " it represents an approach that is very different from all the deep-learning stuff that has been in the news .
Stephen Wolfram writes :
Concepts are used as formal tools or models in mathematics , computer science , databases and artificial intelligence where they are sometimes called classes , schema or categories .
According to Carl Benjamin Boyer , in the introduction to his " The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development " , concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions .
Convolution has applications that include probability , statistics , computer vision , natural language processing , image processing and signal processing , engineering , and differential equations .
Digital signal processing ( DSP ) is the use of digital processing , such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processor s , to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations .
DSP applications include audio and speech processing , sonar , radar and other sensor array processing , spectral density estimation , statistical signal processing , digital image processing , data compression , video coding , audio coding , image compression , signal processing for telecommunication s , control system s , biomedical engineering , and seismology , among others .
Applications of DSP include audio signal processing , audio compression , digital image processing , video compression , speech processing , speech recognition , digital communication s , digital synthesizer s , radar , sonar , financial signal processing , seismology and biomedicine .
Dennett is an atheist and secularist , a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board ,
In February 2010 , he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation ' s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers .
In 2018 , he was awarded an honorary degree by Radboud University , located in Nijmegen , Netherlands , for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science .
This stems from Gould 's long-running public debate with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology , which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed , but which Dennett advocated , together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker .Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology , calling it a form of " greedy reductionism , " he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by evolutionary psychology .
In this book he declares himself to be " Brights movement , " and defends the term .
As given in his most recent book , " From Bacteria to Bach and Back " , Dennett 's views are contrary to those of Nick Bostrom .From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds , Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 400 Although acknowledging that it is " possible in principle " to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency , Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such " Artificial general intelligence " project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds , Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. p164-5 and 399-400 According to Dennett , the prospect of superintelligence ( AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains ) is at least 50 years away , and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds , Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.399-400
He also had the help of fellow staff and other academics , some of whom read drafts of the book.These include Richard Dawkins , David Haig , Douglas Hofstadter , Nick Humphrey , Ray Jackendoff , Philip Kitcher , Justin Leiber , Ernst Mayr , Steve Pinker and Kim Sterelny .
Chapter 15 asserts that GÃ¶del 's Theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible .
Provoked by predictions of a technological singularity ( a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing , runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture ) , Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic .
At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium , and in April 2000 , he organized a larger symposium entitled " Spiritual Robots " at Stanford University , in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil , Hans Moravec , Kevin Kelly , Ralph Merkle , Bill Joy , Frank Drake , John Henry Holland and John Koza .
ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966
Joseph Weizenbaum " s ELIZA , running the DOCTOR script , was created to provide a parody of " the responses of a non-directional psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview " Weizenbaum 1976 , p .
It was 15 years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public , and three decades before most people encountered attempts at natural language processing in Internet services like Ask.com or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office Clippit .
In 1969 , George Lucas and Walter Murch incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film " THX-1138 " .
Don Daglow wrote an enhanced version of the program called " Ecala " on a DEC PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1973 before writing the computer role-playing game " Dungeon " ( 1975 ) .
In the 2008 anime RD Sennou Chousashitsu , aka " Real Drive " , a character named Eliza Weizenbaum appears , an obvious tribute to ELIZA and Joseph Weizenbaum .
On July 19 , 2018 , ELIZA was in a brief mention by the protagonist of the movie " Zoe " to support his reasoning behind why his relationship with Zoe , a hyper-realistic Artificial intelligence , wasn 't real .
The Israel i poet David Avidan , who was fascinated with future technologies and their relation to art , desired to explore the use of computers for writing literature .
It was also featured in a 2012 exhibit at Harvard University titled " Go Ask A.L.I.C.E , " as part of a celebration of mathematician Alan Turing ' s 100th birthday .
In artificial intelligence , the frame problem describes an issue with using first-order logic ( FOL ) to express facts about a robot in the world .
This default , sometimes called the " commonsense law of inertia " , was expressed by Raymond Reiter in default logic :
Steve Hanks and Drew McDermott argued , on the basis of their Yale shooting example , that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory .
Fourier analysis has many scientific applications - in physics , partial differential equation s , number theory , combinatorics , signal processing , digital image processing , probability theory , statistics , forensics , option pricing , cryptography , numerical analysis , acoustics , oceanography , sonar , optics , diffraction , geometry , protein structure analysis , and other areas .
In signal processing terms , a function ( of time ) is a representation of a signal with perfect " time resolution " , but no frequency information , while the Fourier transform has perfect " frequency resolution " , but no time information .
In signal processing , the Fourier transform often takes a time series or a function of continuous time , and maps it into a frequency spectrum .
This justifies their use in such diverse branches as image processing , heat conduction , and automatic control .
Throughout his life , Honda 's founder , Soichiro Honda , had an interest in automobiles .
Following the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri , Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and sport utility vehicle boom of the 1990s , all which took a toll on the profitability of the company .
On 23 February 2015 , Honda announced that CEO and President Takanobu Ito would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo by June ; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were expected .
In January 2020 , Honda announced that it would be withdrawing employees working in the city of Wuhan , Hubei , China in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic .
The most recent school of thought on Honda 's strategy was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989 .
In the early 1980s Honda returned to F2 , supplying engines to Ron Tauranac ' s Ralt team .
Between 1986 and 1991 , Honda won six consecutive Formula One Constructors ' Championships as an engine manufacturer , as well as five consecutive Drivers ' Championships with Nelson Piquet , Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost .
Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 1992 , although the related Mugen company maintained a presence up to the end of 2000 , winning four races with Ligier and Jordan .
The project was aborted after the death of its technical director , Harvey Postlethwaite .
In 2003 , Honda released its " Cog " advertisement in the UK and on the Internet .
In the mid to late 2000s in the United States , during model close-out sales for the current year before the start of the new model year , Honda 's advertising has had an animated character known simply as Mr. Opportunity , voiced by Rob Paulsen .
They have Honda employees as well as Danica Patrick , Christopher Guest , Ben Bova , Chee Pearlman , Joe Johnston and Orson Scott Card .
The film series plays at dreams.honda.com. In the UK , national television ads feature voice-overs from American radio host Garrison Keillor , while in the US the voice of Honda commercials is actor and director Fred Savage .
HAL 9000 is a fictional artificial intelligence character and the main antagonist in Arthur C. Clarke ' s " Space Odyssey " series .
First appearing in the 1968 film " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " , HAL ( Heuristically Programmed ALgorithmic Computer ) is a sentient computer ( or artificial general intelligence ) that controls the systems of the " Discovery One " spacecraft and interacts with the ship 's astronaut crew .
HAL 9000 is voiced by Douglas Rain in the two feature film adaptations of the " Space Odyssey " series .
In addition to maintaining the " Discovery One " spacecraft systems during the interplanetary mission to Jupiter ( or Saturn in the novel ) , HAL is capable of speech synthesis , speech recognition , facial recognition system , natural language processing , lip reading , art appreciation , Affective computing , automated reasoning , spacecraft piloting and playing chess .
When HAL 's logic is completely gone , he begins singing the song " Daisy Bell " and starts slowing down and changing pitch similar to an old electronic game running low on batteries ( in actuality , the first song sung by a computer , which Clarke had earlier observed at a speech synthesis demonstration ) .
During rehearsals Kubrick asked Stefanie Powers to supply the voice of HAL 9000 while searching for a suitably androgynous voice so the actors had something to react to .
On the set , British actor Nigel Davenport played HAL .
The scene in which HAL 's consciousness degrades was inspired by Clarke 's memory of a speech synthesis demonstration by physicist .
Marvin Minsky , director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( CSAIL ) and one of the most influential researchers in the field , was an adviser on the film set .
In the film Brazil , the main character wants to be hired at the Information Retrieval department of the Ministry of Information , in order to learn about the woman who appears in his dreams , although the term is used in this context as a threatening euphemism for interrogation and torture .
In mathematical logic and computer science , the Kleene star ( or Kleene operator or Kleene closure ) is a unary operation , either on sets of strings or on sets of symbols or characters .
Knowledge representation and reasoning ( KR Â² , KR & R ) is the field of artificial intelligence ( AI ) dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a dialog in a natural language .
Frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction , e.g. natural language understanding and the social settings in which various default expectations such as ordering food in a restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations .
Work on KQML was led by Tim Finin of the University of Maryland , Baltimore County and Jay Weber of EITech and involved contributions from many researchers .
KRL is a knowledge representation language , developed by Daniel G. Bobrow and Terry Winograd while at Xerox PARC and Stanford University , respectively .
based on an example used by Terry Winograd ref name = " Winograd " to illustrate the programming language Planner .
Logic programming in its present form can be traced back to debates in the late 1960s and early 1970s about declarative versus procedural representations of knowledge in artificial intelligence .
Advocates of declarative representations were notably working at Stanford , associated with John McCarthy , Bertram Raphael and Cordell Green , and in Edinburgh , with John Alan Robinson ( an academic visitor from Syracuse University ) , Pat Hayes , and Robert Kowalski .
Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT , under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert .
The most influential implementation of Planner was the subset of Planner , called Micro-Planner , implemented by Gerald Jay Sussman , Eugene Charniak and Terry Winograd .
The fact that Horn clauses can be given a procedural interpretation and , vice versa , that goal-reduction procedures can be understood as Horn clauses + backward reasoning means that logic programs combine declarative and procedural representations of Knowledge representation .
Colmerauer was working on natural language understanding , using logic to represent semantics and using resolution for question-answering .
Edinburgh Prolog became the " de facto " standard and strongly influenced the definition of International Organization for Standardization standard Prolog .
Inductive logic programming is concerned with generalizing positive and negative examples in the context of background knowledge : machine learning of logic programs .
The earliest known library classification scheme is the Pinakes by Callimachus , a scholar at the Library of Alexandria during the third century BC .
Logo is an educational programming language , designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig , Seymour Papert , and Cynthia Solomon .

Another is a second-generation " Lingua Cosmica " of Leiden University , using constructive logic .
In 1999 , the astrophysicists encoded a message in Lincos and used the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope in Ukraine to beam it towards close stars .
In the 2016 sci-fi blockbuster film , " Arrival " , Stephen Wolfram and his son were consulted by film production to help analyze symbols known as logograms that ultimately served as the basis for the alien language utilized throughout the film .
Important philosophers of mind include Plato , Patanjali , Descartes , Leibniz , Locke , Berkeley , Hume , Kant , Hegel , Schopenhauer , John Searle , Dennett , Fodor , Nagel , and Chalmers .
Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building , dialogue , communication and behavior change and that are designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient , or to improve group relationships ( such as in a family ) .
Examples include control , planning and scheduling , the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions , handwriting recognition , natural language , speech recognition and facial recognition system .
Consequentially natural language understanding and connectionism ( where behavior of neural networks is investigated ) are areas of active research and development .
The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of artificial intelligence .
The India n philosopher -sage Sri Aurobindo attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his integral psychology , as have many philosophers and New religious movement s .
The term is based on the Greek para ( beside / beyond ) , psyche ( soul / mind ) , and logos ( account / explanation ) and was coined by psychologist Max Dessoir in or before 1889.ref name = " EncyOccult " / J.B. Rhine tried to popularize " parapsychology " using fraudulent techniques as a replacement for the earlier term " psychical research , " during a shift in methodologies which brought experimental methods to the study of psychic phenomena .
Often this is generally only possible at the very end of complicated games such as chess or go , since it is not computationally feasible to look ahead as far as the completion of the game , except towards the end , and instead , positions are given finite values as estimates of the degree of belief that they will lead to a win for one player or another .
According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology as well as Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute molecular manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global catastrophic risk .
Some effects could be beneficial , while others could be detrimental , such as the utilization of molecular nanotechnology by an unfriendly artificial general intelligence .
We are now in a position like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle .
Marvin Lee Minsky ( August 9 , 1927 - January 24 , 2016 ) was an American cognitive scientist concerned largely with research of artificial intelligence ( AI ) , co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ' s AI laboratory , and author of several texts concerning AI and philosophy .
He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1958 , and a year later he and John McCarthy initiated what is , He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences , and professor of electrical engineering and computer science .
It was the simplest known universal Turing machine until Stephen Wolfram ' s ( 2,3 ) Turing machine was proven to be universal in 2007 .
Minsky wrote the book " Perceptrons " ( with Seymour Papert ) , attacking the work of Frank Rosenblatt , which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural network s .
Minsky received a $ 100,000 research grant from Jeffrey Epstein in 2002 , four years before Epstein 's first arrest for sex offenses ; it was the first from Epstein to MIT .
The semantic network was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by Allan M. Collins and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s .
Machine translation , sometimes referred to by the abbreviation MT ( not to be confused with computer-aided translation , machine-aided human translation ( MAHT ) or interactive translation ) , is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another .
Improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention : for example , some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has word sense disambiguation which words in the text are proper names .
The field of machine translation was founded with Warren Weaver ' s Memorandum on Translation ( 1949 ) .
Beginning in the late 1980s , as computation al power increased and became less expensive , more interest was shown in statistical machine translation .
Recently , Google announced that Google Translate translates roughly enough text to fill 1 million books in one day ( 2012 ) .
Warren Weaver wrote an important memorandum " Translation " in 1949 .
The Georgetown experiment was by no means the first such application , and a demonstration was made in 1954 on the APEXC machine at Birkbeck College ( University of London ) of a rudimentary translation of English into French .
It is often argued that the success of machine translation requires the problem of natural language understanding to be solved first .
A deep learning based approach to MT , neural machine translation has made rapid progress in recent years , and Google has announced its translation services are now using this technology in preference to its previous statistical methods .
If named entities cannot be recognized by the machine translator , they may be erroneously translated as common nouns , which would most likely not affect the Bilingual evaluation understudy rating of the translation but would change the text 's human readability.message .
A frustrating outcome of the same study by Stanford ( and other attempts to improve named recognition translation ) is that many times , a decrease in the Bilingual evaluation understudy scores for translation will result from the inclusion of methods for named entity translation .
In Natural language processing , ontologies can be used as a source of knowledge for machine translation systems .
Other areas of usage for ontologies within NLP include information retrieval , information extraction and automatic summarization .
The ontology generated for the PANGLOSS knowledge-based machine translation system in 1993 may serve as an example of how an ontology for Natural language processing purposes can be compiled :
For example , statistical machine translation ( SMT ) typically outperforms example-based machine translation ( EBMT ) , but researchers found that when evaluating English to French translation , EBMT performs better .
Cleve Moler , the chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico , started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s .
It is now also used in education , in particular the teaching of linear algebra and numerical analysis , and is popular amongst scientists involved in image processing .
MATLAB does include standard codefor / code and codewhile / code loops , but ( as in other similar applications such as R ) , using the vectorized notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute .
Libraries written in Perl , Java , ActiveX or .NET can be directly called from MATLAB ,
Mathematical models are used in the natural science s ( such as physics , biology , earth science , chemistry ) and engineering disciplines ( such as computer science , electrical engineering ) , as well as in the social science s ( such as economics , psychology , sociology , political science ) .
If the modeling is done by an artificial neural network or other machine learning , the optimization of parameters is called " training " , while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called " tuning " and often uses cross-validation ..
This practice is referred to as cross-validation in statistics .
But even an official language with a regulating academy , such as Standard French with the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise , is classified as a natural language ( for example , in the field of natural language processing ) , as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a constructed language or controlled enough to be classified as a controlled natural language .
ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks , including computer vision , speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering , playing board and video games , medical diagnosis , and even in activities that have traditionally been considered as reserved to humans , like painting .
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts using principles of dynamic programming .
Geoffrey Hinton et al .
( 2006 ) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variable s with a restricted Boltzmann machine Unsupervised pre-training and increased computing power from GPU s and distributed computing allowed the use of larger networks , particularly in image and visual recognition problems , which became known as " deep learning " { { cite book | title = Deep Learning | author = Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville | publisher = MIT Press | url =
Ciresan and colleagues ( 2010 ) For example , the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory ( LSTM ) Graves , Alex ; and Schmidhuber , JÃ¼rgen ; ' , in Bengio , Yoshua ; Schuurmans , Dale ; Lafferty , John ; Williams , Chris K. I. ; and Culotta , Aron ( eds .
The neurons are typically organized into multiple layers , especially in deep learning .
The weight updates can be done via stochastic gradient descent or other methods , such as Extreme Learning Machines , and non-connectionist neural networks .
The three major learning paradigms are supervised learning , unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning .
Supervised learning uses a set of paired inputs and desired outputs .
Tasks suited for supervised learning are pattern recognition ( also known as classification ) and regression ( also known as function approximation ) .
In unsupervised learning , input data is given along with the cost function , some function of the data math \ textstyle x / math and the network 's output .
In reinforcement learning , the aim is to weight the network ( devise a policy ) to perform actions that minimize long-term ( expected cumulative ) cost .
Two modes of learning are available : stochastic gradient descent and batch .
Some of the main breakthroughs include : convolutional neural network nowiki / s that have proven particularly successful in processing visual and other two-dimensional data ;
The multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator , as proven by the universal approximation theorem .
The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and to select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error .
Supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error ( MSE ) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model .
JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber noted that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware : from 1991 to 2015 , computing power , especially as delivered by GPGPUs ( on GPUs ) , has increased around a million-fold , making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before .
In collaboration with Edward S. Herman , Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in " Manufacturing Consent " and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor .
On visits to New York City , Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal " Fraye Arbeter Shtime " and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker , a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism .
Chomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism , and totalitarianism more generally , but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial .
Chomsky was married to Carol Chomsky (
In February 2020 , before attending the 2020 Hay Festival in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , Chomsky signed a letter of condemnation of the violation of freedom of speech in the emirate , referring to the arrest of human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor .
Other signers included authors Stephen Fry and Jung Chang .
In the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the Linguistic Society of America , the American Philosophical Association , and the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Chomsky received the 2004 Carl von Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg , Germany , to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic .
Chomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago ( 1967 ) , Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College ( 1970 ) , Bard College ( 1971 ) , Delhi University ( 1972 ) , and the University of Massachusetts ( 1973 ) among others .
Natural language processing ( NLP ) is a subfield of linguistics , computer science , information engineering , and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human ( natural ) languages , in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data .
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition , natural language understanding , and natural language generation .
In 1950 , Alan Turing published an article titled " Computing Machinery and Intelligence " which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence .
Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed .
Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU , a natural language system working in restricted " blocks world s " with restricted vocabularies , and ELIZA , a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist , written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 .
Starting in the late 1980s , however , there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing .
Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms , such as decision tree s , produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules .
However , part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing , and increasingly , research has focused on statistical models , which make soft , probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data .
The cache language model s upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models .
Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of machine translation , due especially to work at IBM Research , where successively more complicated statistical models were developed .
These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government .
Recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning algorithms .
Generally , this task is much more difficult than supervised learning , and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data .
In the 2010s , representation learning and deep learning -style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing , due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques and many others .
For instance , the term " neural machine translation " ( NMT ) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations , obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation ( SMT ) .
In the early days , many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules : such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming .
Some of the earliest-used algorithms , such as decision tree s , produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of handwritten rules that were then common .
Finally , in 1740 , Thomas Simpson described Newton 's method as an iterative method for solving general nonlinear equations using calculus , essentially giving the description above .
In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision , and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range , and in some variations also altitude to a target .
A primitive way to determine the distance to the Sun in terms of the distance to the Moon was already proposed by Aristarchus of Samos in his book " On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon " .
Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics .
or equivalently using DCG notation :
The International Organization for Standardization Prolog standard consists of two parts .
This tends to yield very large performance gains when working with large corpora such as WordNet .
David H. D. Warren took this interpreter to Edinburgh , and there implemented an alternative front-end , which came to define the " Edinburgh Prolog " syntax used by most modern implementations .
An archaic British word meaning " possession by spirits ( pixie s ) , " the term has been used to describe the animation process since the early 1950s ; various animators , including Norman McLaren and Grant Munro , are credited with popularizing it .
Perception is not only the passive receipt of these Signal processing , but it 's also shaped by the recipient 's learning , memory , expectation , and attention .
Philosopher Andy Clark explains that perception , although it occurs quickly , is not simply a bottom-up process ( where minute details are put together to form larger wholes ) .
Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda ' s " Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility " ( ASIMO ) and TOSY ' s " TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot " ( TOPIO ) to industrial robot s , medical operating robot s , patient assist robots , dog therapy robots , collectively programmed " swarm " robots , UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator , and even microscopic nano robots .
The branch of technology that deals with the design , construction , operation , and application of robots , as well as computer systems for their control , sensory feedback , and information processing is robotics .
Robota , in Slovak , is used to just mean work. the word ' robot ' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play " R.U.R. " " ( Rossumovi UniverzÃ¡lnÃ­ Roboti - Rossum 's Universal Robots ) " by the Czech Republic writer , Karel Äapek but it was Karel 's brother Josef Äapek who was the word 's true inventor .
Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers , especially al-Jazari , as follows : blockquoteUnlike the Greek designs , these Arab examples reveal an interest , not only in dramatic illusion , but in manipulating the environment for human comfort .
In Renaissance Italy , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495 .
According to " EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica " , Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari .
The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedo es by John Ericsson ( pneumatic ) , John Louis Lay ( electric wire guided ) , and Victor von Scheliha ( electric wire guided ) .
The Brennan torpedo , invented by Louis Brennan in 1877 , was powered by two contra-rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo .
'Robot ' was first applied as a term for artificial automata in the 1920 play " R.U.R. " by the Czech Republic writer , Karel Äapek .
Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation .
His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks , Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden .
The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate .
The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. by KUKA robotics in Germany , and the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976 , and the design was sold to Unimation .
Robot Operating System is an open-source set of programs being developed at Stanford University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich , Germany , among others .
The word robotics , used to describe this field of study , )
This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics , the European Robotics Research Network ( EURON ) and many national standards committees .
The International Federation of Robotics has proposed a tentative definition , " A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment , excluding manufacturing operations .
A " collaborative robot " or " cobot " is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks .
Rethink Robotics - founded by Rodney Brooks , previously with iRobot - introduced Baxter in September 2012 ; as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers , and be programmable for performing simple tasks .
In 2009 , experts attended a conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI ) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy , and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard .
The World Bank ' s World Development Report 2019 puts forth evidence showing that while automation displaces workers , technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance .
A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines , with one robot for every ten human workers .
Mass-produced printed circuit board s ( PCBs ) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots , typically with SCARA manipulators , which remove tiny electronic component s from strips or trays , and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy .
The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has studied this topic in depth
According to the " Oxford English Dictionary , " the first passage in Asimov 's short story " Liar ! " ( 1941 ) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word " robotics " .
More recently , fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as " A.I. Artificial Intelligence " and " Ex Machina " and the 2016 TV adaptation of " Westworld " have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves .
He is involved in fields such as optical character recognition ( OCR ) , speech synthesis , speech recognition technology , and electronic keyboard instruments .
He has written books on health , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , transhumanism , the technological singularity , and futurism .
Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements , and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on life extension technologies and the future of nanotechnology , robotics , and biotechnology .
He was born to secular Jew ish parents who had emigrated from Austria just before the onset of World War II .
His uncle , an engineer at Bell Labs , taught young Kurzweil the basics of computer science .
While in high school , Kurzweil had corresponded with Marvin Minsky and was invited to visit him at MIT , which he did .
Kurzweil also visited Frank Rosenblatt at Cornell .
He went to MIT to study with Marvin Minsky .
In 1974 , Kurzweil founded Kurzweil Computer Products , Inc. and led development of the first omni-font optical character recognition system , a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font .
However , this device required the invention of two enabling technologies - the CCD flatbed scanner and the Speech synthesis synthesizer .
Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions such as Bell Labs , and on January 13 , 1976 , the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by him and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind .
After a 1982 meeting with Stevie Wonder , in which the latter lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments , Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of music synthesizers capable of accurately duplicating the sounds of real instruments .
Kurzweil Music Systems was sold to South Korea n musical instrument manufacturer Young Chang in 1990 .
Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems , Kurzweil created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence ( KAI ) to develop computer speech recognition systems for commercial use .
The first product , which debuted in 1987 , was an early speech recognition program .
Kurzweil has joined the Alcor Life Extension Foundation , a cryonics company .
" The Singularity Is Near " , published in 2005 , was made into a movie starring Pauley Perrette from NCIS .
Part fiction , part non-fiction , the film blends interviews with 20 big thinkers ( such as Marvin Minsky ) with a narrative story that illustrates some of his key ideas , including a computer avatar ( Ramona ) who saves the world from self-replicating microscopic robots .
Filmmakers Barry Ptolemy and Felicia Ptolemy followed Kurzweil , documenting his global speaking-tour .
In 2010 , an independent documentary film called " Plug & Pray " premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival , in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics , the late Joseph Weizenbaum , argue about the benefits of eternal life .
Kurzweil was working with the Army Science Board in 2006 to develop a rapid response system to deal with the possible abuse of biotechnology .
In December 2004 , Kurzweil joined the advisory board of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute .
In May 2013 , Kurzweil was the keynote speaker at the 2013 proceeding of the Research , Innovation , Start-up and Employment ( RISE ) international conference in Seoul , South Korea .
Daniel Lyons , writing in " Newsweek " magazine , criticized Kurzweil for some of his predictions that turned out to be wrong , such as the economy continuing to boom from the 1998 dot-com through 2009 , a US company having a market capitalization of more than $ 1 trillion by 2009 , a supercomputer achieving 20 petaflops , speech recognition being in widespread use and cars that would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways ; all by 2009 .
In 2008 , Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the National Academy of Engineering that solar power will scale up to produce all the energy needs of Earth 's people in 20 years .
Mitch Kapor , the founder of Lotus Development Corporation , has called the notion of a technological singularity " intelligent design for the IQ 140 people ... This proposition that we 're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different - it 's fundamentally , in my view , driven by a religious impulse .
Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has said of Kurzweil 's and Hans Moravec ' s books : " It 's an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas , and it 's very hard to disentangle the two , because these are smart people ; they 're not stupid .
" The Brain Makers " , a history of artificial intelligence written in 1994 by HP Newquist , noted that " Born with the same gift for self-promotion that was a character trait of people like P.T. Barnum and Edward Feigenbaum , Kurzweil had no problems talking up his technical prowess .
In his novel " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? " ( the inspiration for " Blade Runner " ) , Philip K. Dick used the term android ( or " andy " ) , but director Ridley Scott wanted a new term that the audience would not have any preconceptions about .
As David Peoples was re-writing the screenplay , he consulted his daughter , who was involved in microbiology and biochemistry .
From that , either Peoples or Scott - each would later recall it was the other - came up with " replicant " , and it was inserted into Hampton Fancher ' s screenplay.Interview with David Peoples in " Sacrificial Sheep : The Novel vs. the Film " .
Harrison Ford , who played Deckard in the film , has said that he did not think Deckard is a replicant , and has said that he and director Ridley Scott had discussions that ended in the agreement that the character was human .
In the early 2000s , actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a film based on " Rendezvous with Rama .
Before the official Hawaiian name ' Oumuamua was selected by the International Astronomical Union , a popular choice was " Rama " .
The signals are usually processed in a digital representation , so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing , applied to speech signals .
The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis .
Linear predictive coding ( LPC ) , a speech processing algorithm , was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) in 1966 .
By the early 2000s , the dominant speech processing strategy started to shift away from Hidden Markov model towards more modern neural networks and deep learning .
Source separation , blind signal separation ( BSS ) or blind source separation , is the separation of a set of source signal processing from a set of mixed signals , without the aid of information ( or with very little information ) about the source signals or the mixing process .
It is most commonly applied in digital signal processing and involves the analysis of mixtures of signals ; the objective is to recover the original component signals from a mixture signal .
In one approach , exemplified by principal and independent component analysis , one seeks source signals that are minimally correlated or maximally independent in a probabilistic or information theory sense .
This is often used as a form of knowledge representation .
Semantic networks are used in natural language processing applications such as semantic parsing Poon , Hoifung , and Pedro Domingos .
In computing history , " Semantic Nets " for the propositional calculus were first implemented for computers by Richard H. Richens of the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1956 as an " interlingua " for machine translation of natural language s .
In the late 1980s , two Netherlands universities , University of Groningen and University of Twente , jointly began a project called " Knowledge Graphs " , which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations , to facilitate algebras on the graph .
An example of a semantic network is WordNet , a lexical database of English .
It is also possible to represent logical descriptions using semantic networks such as the existential graph s of Charles Sanders Peirce or the related conceptual graph s of John F. Sowa .
There are many approaches to learning these embeddings , notably using Bayesian clustering frameworks or energy-based frameworks , and more recently , TransE ( Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2013 ) .
Applications of embedding knowledge base data include Social network analysis and Relationship extraction .
The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data ( or data web )
The 2001 " Scientific American " article by Berners-Lee , James Hendler , and Ora Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web .
The concept of the semantic network model was formed in the early 1960s by researchers such as the cognitive scientist Allan M. Collins , linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge .
The term " Semantic Web " was coined by Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium ( " W3C " ) , which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards .
Tim Berners-Lee has described the semantic web as a component of " Web 3.0 .
The World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web ( URW3-XG ) final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of " uncertainty .
Peter GÃ¤rdenfors and Timo Honkela point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics .
Since 2008 , the Corporate Semantic Web research group , located at the Free University of Berlin , focuses on building blocks : Corporate Semantic Search , Corporate Semantic Collaboration , and Corporate Ontology Engineering .
The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy , such as reciprocal centimeters or electron volt s , which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength .
A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral line s and measuring their wavelength s and intensities .
Signal processing is an electrical engineering subfield that focuses on analysing , modifying , and synthesizing signal s such as sound , image processing , and biological measurements .
Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers .
It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science , linguistics and computer engineering fields .
Most recently , the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data .
Raj Reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at Stanford University in the late 1960s .
Around this time Soviet researchers invented the dynamic time warping ( DTW ) algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200-word vocabulary .
A decade later , at CMU , Raj Reddy 's students James Baker and Janet M. Baker began using the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) for speech recognition .
| Apple Apple Inc originally licensed software from Nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant Siri .
Today , however , many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called Long short-term memory ( LSTM ) , a recurrent neural network published by Sepp Hochreiter & JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber in 1997 .
The use of deep feedforward ( non-recurrent ) networks for acoustic model ing was introduced during later part of 2009 by Geoffrey Hinton and his students at University of Toronto and by Li Deng In contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades , the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by 30 % .
But these methods never won over the non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model ( GMM-HMM ) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively .
Both acoustic model ing and language model ing are important parts of modern statistically-based speech recognition algorithms .
Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as document classification or statistical machine translation .
Speech can be thought of as a Markov model for many stochastic purposes .
The features would have so-called delta and delta-delta coefficient s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis ( HLDA ) ; or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use splicing and an Linear Discriminant Analysis -based projection followed perhaps by heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis or a global semi-tied co variance transform ( also known as maximum likelihood linear transform , or MLLT ) .
One fundamental principle of deep learning is to do away with hand-crafted feature engineering and to use raw features .
Traditional phonetic-based ( i.e. , all Hidden Markov model -based model ) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation , acoustic and language model .
The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification ( CTC ) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014 .
As an alternative to this navigation by hand , cascaded use of speech recognition and information extraction has been studied as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off .
Prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with word processor s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in brain AVM patients who have been treated with resection .
There has also been much useful work in Canada .
Speech recognition and speech synthesis techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot , thus reducing training and support personnel .
Accuracy is usually rated with word error rate ( WER ) , whereas speed is measured with the real time factor .
Other measures of accuracy include Single Word Error Rate ( SWER ) and Command Success Rate ( CSR ) .
Popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include SpeechTEK and SpeechTEK Europe , ICASSP , Interspeech / Eurospeech , and the IEEE ASRU .
Conferences in the field of natural language processing , such as Association for Computational Linguistics , North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics , EMNLP , and HLT , are beginning to include papers on speech processing .
Important journals include the IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing ( later renamed IEEE Transactions on Audio , Speech and Language Processing and since Sept 2014 renamed IEEE / ACM Transactions on Audio , Speech and Language Processing - after merging with an ACM publication ) , Computer Speech and Language , and Speech Communication .
In terms of freely available resources , Carnegie Mellon University ' s Sphinx toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting .
Another resource ( free but copyrighted ) is the HTK book ( and the accompanying HTK toolkit ) .
For more recent and state-of-the-art techniques , Kaldi toolkit can be used .
With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010 , SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based / statistical machine translation ( SMT ) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace .
Large numbers of Russian scientific and technical documents were translated using SYSTRAN under the auspices of the USAF Foreign Technology Division ( later the National Air and Space Intelligence Center ) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , Ohio .

Since the early 1990s , it has been recommended by several authorities , including the Audio Engineering Society , that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present , which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range.AES-6id-2000 This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media , or muting circuits .
In signal processing , group delay is the time delay of the amplitude envelopes of the various sinusoid al components of a signal through a device under test , and is a function of frequency for each component .
In linear time-invariant ( LTI ) system theory , control theory , and in digital signal processing or analog signal processing , the relationship between the input signal , math \ displaystyle x ( t ) / math , to output signal , math \ displaystyle y ( t ) / math , of an LTI system is governed by a convolution operation :
Heterodyning is a signal processing technique invented by Canadian inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden that creates new frequencies by combining or mixing two frequencies .

In signal processing and telecommunication , pulse duration is the interval between the time , during the first transition , that the amplitude of the pulse reaches a specified fraction ( level ) of its final amplitude , and the time the pulse amplitude drops , on the last transition , to the same level .
Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data set s involving methods at the intersection of machine learning , statistics , and database system s .
Often the more general terms ( " large scale " ) " data analysis " and " analytics " - or , when referring to actual methods , " artificial intelligence " and " machine learning " - are more appropriate .
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown , interesting patterns such as groups of data records ( cluster analysis ) , unusual records ( anomaly detection ) , and dependencies ( association rule mining , sequential pattern mining ) .
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset , e.g. , analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign , regardless of the amount of data ; in contrast , data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.Olson , D. L. ( 2007 ) .
In the academic community , the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ( KDD-95 ) was started in Montreal under AAAI sponsorship .
As data set s have grown in size and complexity , direct " hands-on " data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect , automated data processing , aided by other discoveries in computer science , specially in the field of machine learning , such as neural networks , cluster analysis , genetic algorithms ( 1950s ) , decision tree learning and decision rules ( 1960s ) , and support vector machines ( 1990s ) .
A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting , but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train / test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening .
The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery ' s ( ACM ) Special Interest Group ( SIG ) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ( SIGKDD ) .

Linear predictive coding ( LPC ) , a form of speech coding , began development with the work of Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) in 1966 .
Dominant systems in the 1980s and 1990s were the DECtalk system , based largely on the work of Dennis Klatt at MIT , and the Bell Labs system ; the latter was one of the first multilingual language-independent systems , making extensive use of natural language processing methods .
Typically , the division into segments is done using a specially modified speech recognition set to a " forced alignment " mode with some manual correction afterward , using visual representations such as the waveform and spectrogram .
Unit selection provides the greatest naturalness , because it applies only a small amount of digital signal processing ( DSP ) to the recorded speech .
At runtime , the target prosody of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of digital signal processing techniques such as linear predictive coding , PSOLA

" Where Mathematics Comes From : How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being " ( hereinafter " WMCF " ) is a book by George Lakoff , a cognitive linguist , and Rafael E. NÃºÃ±ez , a psychologist .
NÃºÃ±ez , educated in Switzerland , is a product of Jean Piaget ' s school of cognitive psychology as a basis for logic and mathematics .
Between 2003 and 2008 , Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank , the now defunct Rockridge Institute .
First , using evidence from neuroscience and neural network simulations , he argues that certain concepts , such as color and spatial relation concepts ( e.g. " red " or " over " ; see also " qualia " ) , can be almost entirely understood through the examination of how processes of perception or motor control work .
Lakoff is , with coauthors Mark Johnson and Rafael E. NÃºÃ±ez , one of the primary proponents of the embodied mind thesis .
Lakoff and Rafael E. NÃºÃ±ez ( 2000 ) argue at length that mathematical and philosophical ideas are best understood in light of the embodied mind .

Artificial intelligence has retained the most attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation , but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to AI .
Since the mid-1970s , researchers in the field of artificial intelligence ( AI ) have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems .
There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies , but this area of research is still ongoing , and it 's a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry .
Aspects of ontology editors include : visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model , inference engine s and information extraction ; support for modules ; the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching ; and the support of meta-ontologies such as OWL-S , Dublin Core , etc .

Science fiction scholar James Gunn writes in 1982 , " The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis : the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme .
In the officially licensed " Foundation " sequels " Foundation 's Fear " , " Foundation and Chaos " and " Foundation 's Triumph " ( by Gregory Benford , Greg Bear and David Brin respectively ) the future Galactic Empire is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by R. Daneel Olivaw .
Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue artificial intelligence - specifically , a simulation of the long-dead Voltaire - which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws .
David Langford has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws :
In March 2007 the South Korea n government announced that later in the year it would issue a " Robot Ethics Charter " setting standards for both users and manufacturers .
The futurist Hans Moravec ( a prominent figure in the transhumanist movement ) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to " corporate intelligences " - the corporation s driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future .
In contrast , the David Brin novel " Foundation 's Triumph " ( 1999 ) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence : Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play .
The film " Bicentennial Man " ( 1999 ) features Robin Williams as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 ( the serial number is partially a reference to Stanley Kubrick ' s signature numeral ) .
The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name , " I , Robot " is " suggested by " Asimov 's robot fiction stories " Suggested by " Isaac Asimov 's robot stories - two stops removed from " based on " and " inspired by , " the credit implies something scribbled on a bar napkin - Alex Proyas ' science-fiction thriller " I , Robot " sprinkles Asimov 's ideas like seasoning on a giant bucket of popcorn .
Marc Rotenberg , President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) and Professor of information privacy law at Georgetown Law , argues that the Laws of Robotics should be expanded to include two new laws :
Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo , which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions , and have found application in Bayesian statistics and artificial intelligence .
Usually the term " Markov chain " is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times , that is , a discrete-time Markov chain ( DTMC ) , In addition , there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories ( see Markov model ) .
Hidden Markov model s are the basis for most modern automatic speech recognition systems .
Claude Shannon ' s famous 1948 paper " A Mathematical Theory of Communication " , which in a single step created the field of information theory , opens by introducing the concept of entropy through Markov modeling of the English language .
They also allow effective state estimation and pattern recognition .
Markov chains also play an important role in reinforcement learning .
An example is the reformulation of the idea , originally due to Karl Marx ' s Das Kapital , tying economic development to the rise of capitalism .
Markov processes can also be used to natural language generation given a sample document .
In machine learning , support-vector machines ( SVMs , also support-vector networks ) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithm s that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis .
When data are unlabelled , supervised learning is not possible , and an unsupervised learning approach is required , which attempts to find natural Cluster analysis to groups , and then map new data to these formed groups .
Classifying data is a common task in machine learning .
To extend SVM to cases in which the data are not linearly separable , we introduce the " hinge loss " function ,
The classical approach , which involves reducing ( 2 ) to a quadratic programming problem , is detailed below .
Since the dual maximization problem is a quadratic function of the math c _ i / math subject to linear constraints , it is efficiently solvable by quadratic programming algorithms .
As such , traditional gradient descent ( or Stochastic gradient descent ) methods can be adapted , where instead of taking a step in the direction of the function 's gradient , a step is taken in the direction of a vector selected from the function 's sub-gradient .
Coordinate descent algorithms for the SVM work from the dual problem
The soft-margin support vector machine described above is an example of an empirical risk minimization ( ERM ) algorithm for the " hinge loss " .
In light of the above discussion , we see that the SVM technique is equivalent to empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization , where in this case the loss function is the hinge loss
From this perspective , SVM is closely related to other fundamental classification algorithm s such as regularized least-squares and logistic regression .
Typically , each combination of parameter choices is checked using cross validation , and the parameters with best cross-validation accuracy are picked .
The dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems .
Transductive support-vector machines extend SVMs in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semi-supervised learning by following the principles of transduction .
There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming ( QP ) problem that arises from SVMs , mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller , more manageable chunks .
The special case of linear support-vector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin , logistic regression ; this class of algorithms includes Stochastic gradient descent ( e.g. , PEGASOS ) .
The general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using Stochastic gradient descent ( e.g. P-packSVM ) , especially when parallelization is allowed .
Kernel SVMs are available in many machine-learning toolkits , including LIBSVM , MATLAB , and others .
The projective chirp is ideally suited to image processing , and forms the basis for the projective chirplet transform .
Reinforcement learning ( RL ) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agent s ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward .
Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms , alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning .
The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process ( MDP ) , because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques .
Reinforcement learning , due to its generality , is studied in many other disciplines , such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimization , multi-agent system s , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithm s .
It has been applied successfully to various problems , including robot control , elevator scheduling , telecommunications , backgammon , checkers and Go ( AlphaGo ) .
However , reinforcement learning converts both planning problems to machine learning problems .
Value iteration can also be used as a starting point , giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants .
If the gradient of math \ rho / math was known , one could use gradient descent .
The first book to feature a hologram on the front cover was " The Skook " ( Warner Books , 1984 ) by JP Miller , featuring an illustration by Miller .
During the 1980s , many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so-called " new medium " in the art world , such as Harriet Casdin-Silver of the United States , Dieter Jung of Germany , and MoysÃ©s Baumstein of Brazil , each one searching for a proper " language " to use with the three-dimensional work , avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object .
Examples of applications of such real-time holograms include phase-conjugate mirror s ( " time-reversal " of light ) , optical cache memories , image processing ( pattern recognition of time-varying images ) , and optical computing .
Examples of this digital version of Pepper 's ghost illusion include the Gorillaz performances in the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards and the 48th Grammy Awards ; and Tupac Shakur ' s virtual performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012 , rapping alongside Snoop Dogg during his set with Dr. Dre .
In computational linguistics , word-sense disambiguation ( WSD ) is an open problem concerned with identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence .
In computer science and the information technology that it enables , it has been a long-term challenge to develop the ability in computers to do natural language processing and machine learning .
Warren Weaver , in his famous 1949 memorandum on translation , that WSD could not be solved by " electronic computer " because of the need in general to model all world knowledge .
In the 1970s , WSD was a subtask of semantic interpretation systems developed within the field of artificial intelligence , starting with Yorick Wilks ' preference semantics .
Most research in the field of WSD is performed by using WordNet as a reference sense inventory for English .
In any real test , part-of-speech tagging and sense tagging are very closely related with each potentially making constraints to the other .
The success rate for part-of-speech tagging algorithms is at present much higher than that for WSD , state-of-the art being around 95 % accuracy in word sense disambiguation with supervised learning .
Some AI researchers like Douglas Lenat argue that one cannot parse meanings from words without some form of common sense ontology .
For example , the ambiguity of ' mouse ' ( animal or device ) is not relevant in English-French machine translation , but is relevant in information retrieval .
As in all natural language processing , there are two main approaches to WSD - deep approach es and shallow approach es .
Two shallow approaches used to train and then disambiguate are Naive Bayes classifier and decision tree s .
In recent research , kernel-based methods such as support vector machine s have shown superior performance in supervised learning .
An alternative to the use of the definitions is to consider general word-sense relatedness and to compute the semantic similarity of each pair of word senses based on a given lexical knowledge base such as WordNet .
Supervised learning methods are based on the assumption that the context can provide enough evidence on its own to disambiguate words ( hence , common sense and reasoning are deemed unnecessary ) .
Because of the lack of training data , many word sense disambiguation algorithms use semi-supervised learning , which allows both labeled and unlabeled data .
Unsupervised learning is the greatest challenge for WSD researchers .
The underlying assumption is that similar senses occur in similar contexts , and thus senses can be induced from text by cluster analysis word occurrences using some measure of similarity of context , It is hoped that unsupervised learning will overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck because they are not dependent on manual effort .
Representing words considering their context through fixed size dense vectors ( word embedding s ) has become one of the most fundamental blocks in several NLP systems. an unsupervised disambiguation system uses the similarity between word senses in a fixed context window to select the most suitable word sense using a pre-trained word embedding model and WordNet .
Unsupervised learning rely on knowledge about word senses , which is only sparsely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases .
Supervised learning depend crucially on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense , a requisite that can so far be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes , as it is done in the Senseval exercises .
WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as information retrieval ( IR ) .
It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning , because they rely on word-sense disambiguation .

Urban theorist and ethicist Jane Jacobs made this distinction in less gender-driven terms by differentiating between a ' Guardian Ethic ' and a ' Trader Ethic ' .Jacobs , J. ' Systems of Survival ' , Hodder and Stoughton , London , 1993 .
Further , partly in response to such criticisms , Lakoff and Rafael E. NÃºÃ±ez , in 2000 , proposed a cognitive science of mathematics that would explain mathematics as a consequence of , not an alternative to , the human reliance on conceptual metaphor to understand abstraction in terms of basic experiential concretes .
Conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s , as a machine learning paradigm for unsupervised learning .
It is distinguished from ordinary Cluster analysis by generating a concept description for each generated category .
Categorization tasks in which category labels are provided to the learner for certain objects are referred to as supervised classification , supervised learning , or concept learning .
Categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification , unsupervised learning , or Cluster analysis .
A self-organizing map ( SOM ) or self-organizing feature map ( SOFM ) is a type of artificial neural network ( ANN ) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional ( typically two-dimensional ) , discretized representation of the input space of the training samples , called a map , and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction .
Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning ( such as backpropagation with gradient descent ) , and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space .
The artificial neural network introduced by the Finland professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network .
While it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to Feedforward neural networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached , this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation .
" Training " builds the map using input examples ( a competitive process , also called vector quantization ) , while " mapping " automatically classifies a new input vector .

Robby exhibits artificial intelligence , but has a distinct personality that at times exhibits a dry wit .
The robot 's groundbreaking design and dazzling finish represented a radical advance on the conventional " walking oil-can " depictions of robots in earlier features and film serials , and the only previous film robot of comparable style and quality was the " Menschmaschine " created for Fritz Lang ' s " Metropolis " ( 1927 ) .
Robby was operated ( uncredited ) by stuntmen Frankie Darro and Frankie Carpenter ; both actors were of shorter stature ( Darro was 5 ' 3 " ) .
The Robby voice heard in the finished film was re-recorded in post-production by actor Marvin Miller .
Actor Les Tremayne read the film 's prologue .
Robby also appeared in the " Mork & Mindy " second-season episode " Dr. Morkenstein , " this time representing a character called Chuck ( voiced by actor Roddy McDowall ) whom Mork befriends while working as a security guard in the science museum where Chuck is on display .
Disappointed with the performance of Shakey the robot and similar conscious mind representation-inspired projects , Rodney Brooks started creating robots based on a different notion of intelligence , resembling unconscious mind processes .
The lack of large memory storage , symbolic representations , and central control , however , places it at a disadvantage at learning complex actions , in-depth mapping , and natural language understanding .
With the help of advanced AR technologies ( e.g. adding computer vision , incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and object recognition ) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulated .
Modern mobile augmented-reality systems use one or more of the following motion capture technologies :
Techniques include speech recognition systems that translate a user 's spoken words into computer instructions , and gesture recognition systems that interpret a user 's body movements by visual detection or from sensors embedded in a peripheral device such as a wand , stylus , pointer , glove or other body wear.Marshall , Gary .. Products which are trying to serve as a controller of AR headsets include Wave by Seebright Inc. and Nimble by Intugine Technologies .
That process is called image registration , and uses different methods of computer vision , mostly related to video tracking .Maida , James ; Bowen , Charles ; Montpool , Andrew ; Pace , John .
The first stage is to detect interest points , fiducial markers or optical flow in the camera images .
This step can use feature detection methods like corner detection , blob detection , edge detection or thresholding , and other image processing methods.State , Andrei ; Hirota , Gentaro ; Chen , David T ; Garrett , William ; Livingston , Mark .

In the United States , the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy although the Supreme Court has said several of the amendments to the Constitution implicitly grant this right .
All countries in the European Union are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights which protects individual rights including the right to privacy .
In the United Kingdom the Data Protection Act 1998 imposes legal restrictions on the uses of CCTV recordings and mandates the registration of CCTV systems with the Data Protection Agency .
In Canada , the use of video surveillance has grown very rapidly .
In Sweden , the use of CCTV in public spaces is regulated both nationally and via GDPR ( the European privacy act ) .
In Wiltshire , United Kingdom , 2003 , a pilot scheme for what is now known as " Talking CCTV " was put into action ; allowing operators of CCTV cameras to order offenders to stop what they were doing , ranging from ordering subjects to pick up their rubbish and put it in a bin to ordering groups of vandals to disperse .
In machine learning , naÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple " probabilistic classifier s " based on applying Bayes ' theorem with strong ( naÃ¯ve ) independence assumptions between the features .
It was introduced ( though not under that name ) into the information retrieval community in the early 1960s ,
In the statistics and computer science literature , naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names , including simple Bayes and independence Bayes .
For some types of probability models , naive Bayes classifiers can be trained very efficiently in a supervised learning setting .
In many practical applications , parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood ; in other words , one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods .
" discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems , including the use of tf-idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization , to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machine s .
Given a way to train a naive Bayes classifier from labeled data , it 's possible to construct a semi-supervised learning training algorithm that can learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data by running the supervised learning algorithm in a loop :
Discriminative classifiers have lower asymptotic error than generative ones ; however , research by Ng and Michael I. Jordan has shown that in some practical cases naive Bayes can outperform logistic regression because it reaches its asymptotic error faster .
If a greedy algorithm can be proven to yield the global optimum for a given problem class , it typically becomes the method of choice because it is faster than other optimization methods like dynamic programming .
In machine learning , boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias , and also variance " Can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner ? " A weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification ( it can label examples better than random guessing ) .
Schapire and Freund then developed AdaBoost , an adaptive boosting algorithm that won the prestigious GÃ¶del Prize .
AdaBoost is very popular and the most significant historically as it was the first algorithm that could adapt to the weak learners .
There are many more recent algorithms such as LPBoost , TotalBoost , BrownBoost , xgboost , MadaBoost , LogitBoost , and others .
Many boosting algorithms fit into the AnyBoost framework , which shows that boosting performs gradient descent in a function space using a convex cost function .
Object categorization is a typical task of computer vision that involves determining whether or not an image contains some specific category of object .
Appearance based object categorization typically contains feature extraction , learning a classifier , and applying the classifier to new examples .
Examples of supervised learning are Naive Bayes classifier , Support vector machine , mixtures of Gaussians , and neural network .
However , research has shown that object categories and their locations in images can be discovered in an Unsupervised learning as well.Sivic , Russell , Efros , Freeman & Zisserman , " Discovering objects and their location in images , " ICCV 2005
The recognition of object categories in images is a challenging problem in computer vision , especially when the number of categories is large .
, " Generic Object Recognition with Boosting , " IEEE Transactions on PAMI 2006 Humans are able to recognize thousands of object types , whereas most of the existing object recognition systems are trained to recognize only a few , ) have been developed .
After boosting , a classifier constructed from 200 features could yield a 95 % detection rate under a math10 ^ { -5 } / math false positive rate .P. Viola , M. Jones , " Robust Real-time Object Detection , " 2001
Similar results are shown in the paper " Incremental learning of object detectors using a visual shape alphabet , " yet the authors used AdaBoost for boosting .
Convex algorithms , such as AdaBoost and LogitBoost , can be " defeated " by random noise such that they can 't learn basic and learnable combinations of weak hypotheses.P. Long and R. Servedio .
However , by 2009 , multiple authors demonstrated that boosting algorithms based on non-convex optimization , such as BrownBoost , can learn from noisy datasets and can specifically learn the underlying classifier of the Long-Servedio dataset .
System analysis can be used to represent almost anything from population growth to audio speakers ; electrical engineers often use it because of its direct relevance to many areas of their discipline , most notably signal processing , communication systems and control systems .

In computer science , digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to " process " digital image s through an " algorithm " .
As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing , digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing .
Electronic signal processing was revolutionized by the wide adoption of MOS technology in the 1970s .
" Westworld " ( 1973 ) was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android 's point of view .
Binary images are produced from color images by image segmentation .
This is important in image recognition , for example in optical character recognition .
Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable ( " " hidden " " ) states .
Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech recognition , handwriting recognition , gesture recognition , Thad Starner , Alex Pentland .
Applying the principle of dynamic programming , this problem , too , can be handled efficiently using the forward algorithm .
An example is part-of-speech tagging , where the hidden states represent the underlying parts of speech corresponding to an observed sequence of words .
The task is usually to derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of the HMM given the set of output sequences .
Such a two-level prior distribution , where both concentration parameters are set to produce sparse distributions , might be useful for example in unsupervised learning part-of-speech tagging , where some parts of speech occur much more commonly than others ; learning algorithms that assume a uniform prior distribution generally perform poorly on this task .
An example of this model is the so-called " maximum entropy Markov model " ( MEMM ) , which models the conditional distribution of the states using logistic regression ( also known as a " maximum entropy model " ) .
A year later , in 1965 , Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT wrote ELIZA , an interactive program that carried on a dialogue in English on any topic , the most popular being psychotherapy .

In 1971 Terry Winograd finished writing SHRDLU for his PhD thesis at MIT .
However , it is debated how much " understanding " such systems demonstrate , " e.g. " according to John Searle , Watson did not even understand the questions .
The construction of a rich lexicon with a suitable ontology requires significant effort , " e.g. " , the Wordnet lexicon required many person-years of effort.G. A. Miller , R. Beckwith , C. D. Fellbaum , D. Gross , K. Miller .
SHRDLU was an early natural language understanding computer program , developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968-1970 .
SHRDLU was considered a tremendously successful demonstration of Artificial intelligence .
LDA is a supervised learning algorithm that utilizes the labels of the data , while PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that ignores the labels .
Discriminative training of linear classifiers usually proceeds in a supervised learning way , by means of an optimization algorithm that is given a training set with desired outputs and a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the classifier 's outputs and the desired outputs .
Popular loss functions include the hinge loss ( for linear SVMs ) and the log loss ( for linear logistic regression ) .
If the regularization function Many algorithms exist for solving such problems ; popular ones for linear classification include ( Stochastic gradient descent ) gradient descent , L-BFGS , coordinate descent and Newton method s .

Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts , notably in the fields of linguistics , anesthesia , neuroscience , psychiatry , psychology , education , philosophy , anthropology , biology , systemics , logic , and computer science .
Mary Whiton Calkins ( 1863-1930 ) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology .
It encompasses processes such as memory , association , concept formation , pattern recognition , language , attention , perception , action , problem solving and mental imagery .
Relatively recent fields of study such as neuropsychology aim to bridge this gap , using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions ( see also cognitive neuroscience ) , or to understand how pure information-processing systems ( e.g. , computers ) can simulate human cognition ( see also artificial intelligence ) .
The semantic network of knowledge representation systems has been studied in various paradigms .
The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in George Miller ' s Wordnet .
More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with neural network experiments based on computational systems such as latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) , Bayesian analysis , and multidimensional factor analysis .
In digital signal processing , spatial anti-aliasing is a technique for minimizing the distortion artifacts known as aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution .
Some languages make it possible portably ( e.g. Scheme , Common Lisp , Perl or D ) .
Pattern recognition is closely related to artificial intelligence and machine learning ,
Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled " training " data ( supervised learning ) , but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ( unsupervised learning ) .
Machine learning is strongly related to pattern recognition and originates from artificial intelligence .
Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and Signal Processing into consideration .
It originated in engineering , and the term is popular in the context of computer vision : a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition .
In machine learning , pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value .
In statistics , Linear discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936 .
A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching , which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editor s and word processor s .
" Supervised learning " assumes that a set of " training data " ( the " training set " ) has been provided , consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output .
Unsupervised learning , on the other hand , assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled , and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances .. A combination of the two that has recently been explored is semi-supervised learning , which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data ( typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data ) .

For example , feature extraction algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy , using mathematical techniques such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) .
Essentially , this combines maximum likelihood estimation with a regularization procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models .
Other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic speech recognition , classification of text into several categories ( e.g. , spam / non-spam email messages ) , the handwriting recognition on postal envelopes , automatic recognition of images of human faces , or handwriting image extraction from medical forms .
Artificial neural networks ( neural net classifiers ) and deep learning have many real-world applications in image processing , a few examples :
In psychology , pattern recognition ( making sense of and identifying objects ) is closely related to perception , which explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful .
Translation between frames of reference - languages , cultures , modes of expression , or indeed between one person 's thoughts and another - becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works , such as reference and self-reference , structure and function , and artificial intelligence .
In the year 2015 , an estimated 1.64 million industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to International Federation of Robotics .
The most commonly used robot configurations are articulated robot s , SCARA robots , delta robot s and cartesian coordinate robot s , ( gantry robots or x-y-z robots ) .
George Devol applied for the first robotics patent s in 1954 ( granted in 1961 ) .
The first company to produce a robot was Unimation , founded by Devol and Joseph Engelberger in 1956 .
Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN , manufacturing Unimate s in Japan and England respectively .
In 1969 Victor Scheinman at Stanford University invented the Stanford arm , an all-electric , 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an arm solution .
Scheinman then designed a second arm for the MIT Artificial intelligence Lab , called the " MIT arm .
" Scheinman , after receiving a fellowship from Unimation to develop his designs , sold those designs to Unimation who further developed them with support from General Motors and later marketed it as the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly ( PUMA ) .
Westinghouse sold Unimation to StÃ¤ubli Faverges SCA of France in 1988 , which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and cleanroom applications and even bought the robotic division of Bosch in late 2004 .
Only a few non-Japanese companies ultimately managed to survive in this market , the major ones being : Adept Technology , StÃ¤ubli , the Sweden - Switzerland company ABB Asea Brown Boveri , the Germany company KUKA Robotics and the Italy company Comau .
According to the International Federation of Robotics ( IFR ) study " World Robotics 2019 " , there were about 2,439,543 operational industrial robots by the end of 2017 .
The International Federation of Robotics has predicted a worldwide increase in adoption of industrial robots and they estimated 1.7 million new robot installations in factories worldwide by 2020 .
Chatbots are typically used in dialog system s for various purposes including customer service , request routing , or for information gathering .
While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes , natural language processing processors , and sophisticated Artificial intelligence , others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database .
In 1950 , Alan Turing ' s famous article " Computing Machinery and Intelligence " was published , which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence .
The notoriety of Turing 's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum ' s program ELIZA , published in 1966 , which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human .
One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing .
Usually , Artificial general intelligence fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required .
For example , A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML , which is specific to its function as a dialogue system , and has since been adopted by various other developers of , so-called , Alicebot s .
Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithm s that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held .
Still , there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence , and some software developers focus on the practical aspect , information retrieval .
These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation and natural language understanding ( NLU ) , natural language generation ( NLG ) , machine learning and deep learning .
The My Friend Cayla doll was marketed as a line of dolls which uses speech recognition technology in conjunction with an Android or iOS mobile app to recognize the child 's speech and have a conversation .
The creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area , heavily related to artificial intelligence and machine learning , so the provided solutions , while possessing obvious advantages , have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases .
In signal processing and related disciplines , aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable ( or " aliases " of one another ) when sampled .
Waves must be sampled more densely than two points per wavelength , or the wave arrival direction becomes ambiguous .
Gary A. Klein found that under time pressure , high stakes , and changing parameters , experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions .
A digital signal processor ( DSP ) is a specialized microprocessor chip , with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing .
Prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( DSP ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips .
Electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the MOSFET ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or MOS transistor ) ,
Linear predictive coding ( LPC ) was first developed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) in 1966 , and then further developed by Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs during the early-to-mid-1970s , becoming a basis for the first speech synthesizer DSP chips in the late 1970s .
Data acquisition applications are usually controlled by software programs developed using various general purpose programming languages such as Assembly , BASIC , C , C + + , C # , Fortran , Java , LabVIEW , Lisp , Pascal , etc .
Other programming environments that are used to build DAQ applications include ladder logic , Visual C + + , Visual Basic , LabVIEW , and MATLAB .
Computer science often terms this relationship an " is-a " relationship .
Hyponymy is the most frequently encoded relation among synsets used in lexical databases such as WordNet .
This would be difficult , because abstract information ( such as the speakers ' relative ages ) is often not available during machine translation .
It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games ( Tic-tac-toe , Chess , Go , etc .
Since the minimax algorithm and its variants are inherently depth-first search , a strategy such as iterative deepening is usually used in conjunction with alpha-beta so that a reasonably good move can be returned even if the algorithm is interrupted before it has finished execution .
Practically every formal introduction to cognitive science stresses that it is a highly interdisciplinary research area in which psychology , neuroscience , linguistics , philosophy , computer science , anthropology , and biology are its principal specialized or applied branches .

He was married to cognitive psychologist and Royal Society Fellow Anne Treisman , who died on February 9 , 2018 .
Daniel Kahneman was born in Tel Aviv , Mandatory Palestine in 1934 , where his mother , Rachel , was visiting relatives .
He spent his childhood years in Paris , France , where his parents had emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1920s .
His father , Efrayim , was picked up in the first major round-up of French Jews , but he was released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer , EugÃ¨ne Schueller .
Kahneman and his family then moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1948 , just before the creation of the state of Israel ( Kahneman , 2003 ) .
Kahneman has written of his experience in Vichy France , explaining in part why he entered the field of psychology :
A young economist named Richard Thaler was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the National Bureau of Economic Research during that same year .
Kahneman is a senior scholar and faculty member emeritus at Princeton University ' s Department of Psychology and Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs .

The International Organization for Standardization standard is formally known as ISO / IEC 13250 : 2003 .
Alternatively , it can be used directly with the Perl Module TM ( which also supports LTM ) .
Some work has been undertaken to provide interoperability between the W3C 's RDF / OWL / SPARQL family of semantic web standards and the International Organization for Standardization ' s family of " Topic Maps " standards though the two have slightly different goals .
Business intelligence ( BI ) comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information .
Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction .
Major themes include : self-reference in meme s , language , art and logic ; discussions of philosophical issues important in cognitive science / AI ; analogies and what makes something similar to something else ( specifically what makes , for example , an uppercase letter ' A ' recognizable as such ) ; and lengthy discussions of the work of Robert Axelrod on the prisoner 's dilemma , as well as the idea of superrationality .
CBR traces its roots to the work of Roger Schank and his students at Yale University in the early 1980s .
Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of computer science .
Definitions of the term " Machine vision " vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image .
For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time , simulated annealing may be preferable to alternatives such as gradient descent .
" With mathT = 0 / math the procedure reduces to the greedy algorithm , which makes only the downhill transitions .
In machine learning , the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classification .
The perceptron algorithm was invented in 1958 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt ,
In a 1958 press conference organized by the US Navy , Rosenblatt made statements about the perceptron that caused a heated controversy among the fledgling Artificial intelligence community ; based on Rosenblatt 's statements , " The New York Times " reported the perceptron to be " the embryo of an electronic computer that the Navy expects will be able to walk , talk , see , write , reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence .
This caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years , before it was recognised that a feedforward neural network with two or more layers ( also called a multilayer perceptron ) had greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer ( also called a single layer perceptron ) .
In 1969 a famous book entitled " Perceptrons " by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert showed that it was impossible for these classes of network to learn an XOR function .
It took ten more years until neural network research experienced a resurgence in the 1980s .
The perceptron algorithm is also termed the single-layer perceptron , to distinguish it from a multilayer perceptron , which is a misnomer for a more complicated neural network .
For multilayer perceptron s , where a hidden layer exists , more sophisticated algorithms such as backpropagation must be used .
The perceptron of optimal stability , together with the kernel trick , are the conceptual foundations of the support vector machine .
Other linear classification algorithms include Winnow , support vector machine and logistic regression .
Like most other techniques for training linear classifiers , the perceptron generalizes naturally to multiclass classification .
Since 2002 , perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing ( Collins , 2002 ) .

Overfitting and underfitting can occur in machine learning , in particular .
To lessen the chance of , or amount of , overfitting , several techniques are available ( e.g. model comparison , cross-validation , regularization , early stopping , pruning , Bayesian priors , or dropout ) .
As an extreme example , if there are " p " variables in a linear regression with " p " data points , the fitted line can go exactly through every point .

The underlying model is a hidden Markov model where the state space of the latent variable s is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions .
It is used in a wide range of engineering and econometric applications from radar and computer vision to estimation of structural macroeconomic models , and is an important topic in control theory and control system s engineering .
A review of this and other models is given in Roweis and Zoubin Ghahramani ( 1999 ) , and Hamilton ( 1994 ) , Chapter 13 .
This process has identical structure to the hidden Markov model , except that the discrete state and observations are replaced with continuous variables sampled from Gaussian distributions .

This formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical " machines " or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by Alan Turing ( called Turing machine s ) .
It arose in response to the challenges that Ned Block ' s China Brain ( a.k.a. Chinese nation ) and John Searle ' s Chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under " Criticism " ) .
The Chinese room argument by John Searle is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions .
The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force ( " Luftwaffe " ) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom .
The first of these new " Knickebein " transmitters was set up in 1939 on Stollberg hill in Nordfriesland near the border with Denmark , at Kleve ( Cleves ) near the Dutch border , almost the most westerly point in Germany , and at LÃ¶rrach near the border with France and Switzerland in south-western Germany .
By chance , the Germans had chosen the operating frequency of the " Wotan " system very badly ; it operated on 45 MHz , which just happened to be the frequency of the powerful-but-dormant BBC television transmitter at Alexandra Palace .

With certain assumptions on the function mathF / math ( for example , mathF / math convex and math \ nabla F / math Lipschitz ) and particular choices of math \ gamma / math ( e.g. , chosen either via a line search that satisfies the Wolfe conditions , or the Barzilai-Borwein method shown as following ) ,
In this case , the line search minimization , finding the locally optimal step size math \ gamma / math on every iteration , can be performed analytically , and explicit formulas for the locally optimal math \ gamma / math are known .
For solving linear equations , this algorithm is rarely used , with the conjugate gradient method being one of the most popular alternatives .
The speed of convergence of gradient descent depends on the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues of mathA ^ TA / math , while the speed of convergence of conjugate gradient method has a more complex dependence on the eigenvalues , and can benefit from preconditioning .
This can be done with any of a variety of line search algorithms .
The gradient descent can take many iterations to compute a local minimum with a required accuracy , if the curvature in different directions is very different for the given function .
The gradient descent can be combined with a line search , finding the locally optimal step size math \ gamma / math on every iteration .
An example is the BFGS method which consists in calculating on every step a matrix by which the gradient vector is multiplied to go into a " better " direction , combined with a more sophisticated line search algorithm , to find the " best " value of math \ gamma .
Gradient descent can be viewed as applying Euler 's method for solving ordinary differential equations mathx ' ( t ) = - \ nabla f ( x ( t ) ) / math to a gradient flow .

In signal processing , sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal .
The Audio Engineering Society recommends 48 kHz sampling rate for most applications but gives recognition to 44.1 kHz for Compact Disc ( CD ) and other consumer uses , 32 kHz for transmission-related applications , and 96 kHz for higher bandwidth or relaxed anti-aliasing filter ing .
However , digital signal processing operations can have very high dynamic range , consequently it is common to perform mixing and mastering operations at 32-bit precision and then convert to 16- or 24-bit for distribution .
In this process , which is known as cross-validation , the MSE is often called the mean squared prediction error , and is computed as
Also in regression analysis , " mean squared error , " often referred to as mean squared prediction error or " out-of-sample mean squared error , " can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the true values , over an out-of-sample test space , generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space .
Both linear regression techniques such as analysis of variance estimate the MSE as part of the analysis and use the estimated MSE to determine the statistical significance of the factors or predictors under study .
The mathematical benefits of mean squared error are particularly evident in its use at analyzing the performance of linear regression , as it allows one to partition the variation in a dataset into variation explained by the model and variation explained by randomness .
This property , undesirable in many applications , has led researchers to use alternatives such as the mean absolute error , or those based on the median .
However , in the last years , one can observe appearing of different e-services and related initiatives in developing countries such as Project Nemmadi , MCA21 Mission Mode Project or Digital India even more , in India ; Electronic Government Directorate in Pakistan ; etc .
The image of the written text may be sensed " off line " from a piece of paper by optical scanning ( optical character recognition ) or intelligent word recognition .
Where traditional techniques focus on image segmentation individual characters for recognition , modern techniques focus on recognizing all the characters in a segmented line of text .

Machine learning algorithms train a model based on a finite set of training data .
Early-stopping can be used to regularize non-parametric regression problems encountered in machine learning .
It has been shown , for several boosting algorithms ( including AdaBoost ) , that regularization via early stopping can provide guarantees of consistency , that is , that the result of the algorithm approaches the true solution as the number of samples goes to infinity .
More sophisticated forms use cross-validation - multiple partitions of the data into training set and validation set - instead of a single partition into a training set and validation set .
Negative feedback is widely used in mechanical and electronic engineering , and also within living organisms ,
Being focused on " reaction-based " behaviors ( as originally inspired by the work of Rodney Brooks ) , BEAM robotics attempts to copy the characteristics and behaviours of biological organism s , with the ultimate goal of domesticating these " wild " robots .

The first team with Mark D. Lillibridge , MartÃ­n Abadi , Krishna Bharat , and Andrei Broder , used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at AltaVista to prevent bots from adding Uniform Resource Locator ( URLs ) to their web search engine .
Looking for a way to make their images resistant to optical character recognition ( OCR ) attack , the team looked at the manual of their Brother scanner , which had recommendations for improving OCR 's results ( similar typefaces , plain backgrounds , etc .
The controversy of inventorship has been resolved by the existence of a 1997 priority date patent application by Eran Reshef , Gili Raanan and Eilon Solan ( second group )
Modern text-based CAPTCHAs are designed such that they require the simultaneous use of three separate abilities - invariant recognition , image segmentation , and parsing - to correctly complete the task with any consistency .
In the case of image and text based CAPTCHAs , if an AI were capable of accurately completing the task without exploiting flaws in a particular CAPTCHA design , then it would have solved the problem of developing an AI that is capable of complex object recognition in scenes .
There are a few approaches to defeating CAPTCHAs : using cheap human labor to recognize them , exploiting bugs in the implementation that allow the attacker to completely bypass the CAPTCHA , and finally using machine learning to build an automated solver .
In October 2018 at Association for Computing Machinery CCS ' 18 conference , Ye et al. presented a deep learning-based attack that could successfully solve all 11 text captcha schemes used by the top-50 popular website in 2018 with a high success rate .

Mitchell provided a widely quoted , more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field : " A computer program is said to learn from experience " E " with respect to some class of tasks " T " and performance measure " P " if its performance at tasks in " T " , as measured by " P " , improves with experience " E " .
They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods , as well as what were then termed " neural network s " ; these were mostly perceptron s and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear model s of statistics .
Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly , but while machine learning focuses on prediction , based on " known " properties learned from the training data , data mining focuses on the discovery of ( previously ) " unknown " properties in the data ( this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases ) .
Much of the confusion between these two research communities ( which do often have separate conferences and separate journals , ECML PKDD being a major exception ) comes from the basic assumptions they work with : in machine learning , performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to " reproduce known " knowledge , while in knowledge discovery and data mining ( KDD ) the key task is the discovery of previously " unknown " knowledge .
Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms : data model and algorithmic model , wherein " algorithmic model " means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest .
Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning ( without any labeled training data ) and supervised learning ( with completely labeled training data ) .
Due to its generality , the field is studied in many other disciplines , such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimization , multi-agent system s , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithm s .
Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques .
Examples include artificial neural network s , multilayer perceptron s , and supervised dictionary learning .
Examples include dictionary learning , independent component analysis , autoencoder s , matrix factorization and various forms of Cluster analysis .
A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm .
In data mining , anomaly detection , also known as outlier detection , is the identification of rare items , events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data .
Learning classifier systems ( LCS ) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component , typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component , performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning .
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing .
Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks , including computer vision , speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering , playing board and video games and medical diagnosis .
Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network .
Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition .Honglak Lee , Roger Grosse , Rajesh Ranganath , Andrew Y. Ng .
Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item ( represented in the branches ) to conclusions about the item 's target value ( represented in the leaves ) .
Support vector machines ( SVMs ) , also known as support vector networks , are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression .
Its most common form is linear regression , where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares .
When dealing with non-linear problems , go-to models include polynomial regression ( for example , used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel ) , Logistic regression ( often used in statistical classification ) or even kernel regression , which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space .
Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables , like speech recognition or protein sequences , are called dynamic Bayesian network s .
In comparison , the K-fold- cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model .
Similarly , investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate ( FPR ) as well as the False Negative Rate ( FNR ) .
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision .
It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning , along with supervised learning and reinforcement learning .
Semi-supervised learning , a related variant , makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques .
Two of the main methods used in unsupervised learning are principal component analysis and cluster analysis .
Cluster analysis is used in unsupervised learning to group , or segment , datasets with shared attributes in order to extrapolate algorithmic relationships .
Cluster analysis is a branch of machine learning that groups the data that has not been labelled , classified or categorized .
Hebbian Learning has been hypothesized to underlie a range of cognitive functions , such as pattern recognition and experiential learning .
Among neural network models , the self-organizing map ( SOM ) and adaptive resonance theory ( ART ) are commonly used in unsupervised learning algorithms .
It was a key resource for the famous , but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Singaporean surgeons to separate Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani in 2003 .

Many machine learning practitioners believe that properly optimized feature extraction is the key to effective model construction .
One very important area of application is image processing , in which algorithm s are used to detect and isolate various desired portions or shapes ( features ) of a digitized image or video stream .
It is particularly important in the area of optical character recognition .
Common numerical programming environments such as MATLAB , SciLab , NumPy , Sklearn and the R language provide some of the simpler feature extraction techniques ( e.g. principal component analysis ) via built-in commands .

The Pattern Playback was an early speech synthesizer , designed at Haskins Laboratories in the late 1940s , that converted pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech ( spectrograms ) back into sound .
Connectionists are in agreement that recurrent neural networks ( directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle ) are a better model of the brain than feedforward neural networks ( directed networks with no cycles , called DAG ) .
A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate gradient descent over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix .
Backpropagation ( BP ) , first made popular in the 1980s , is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today .
PDP 's direct roots were the perceptron theories of researchers such as Frank Rosenblatt from the 1950s and 1960s .
But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book " Perceptrons " by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert , published in 1969 .
But by the early 20th century , Edward Thorndike was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network .
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers ( such as Ron Sun ) .

In computer science , evolutionary computation is a family of algorithm s for global optimization inspired by biological evolution , and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms .
Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings , making them popular in computer science .
" Evolutionary programming " was introduced by Lawrence J. Fogel in the US , while John Henry Holland called his method a " genetic algorithm " .
In Germany Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel introduced " evolution strategies " .

However , by formulating the problem as the solution of a Toeplitz matrix and using Levinson recursion , we can relatively quickly estimate a filter with the smallest mean squared error possible .
In signal processing , a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon .
Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content , and the information of a signal is often accompanied by noise .
In the latter half of the 20th century , electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines , specialising in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals ; electronic engineering and computer engineering as examples ; while design engineering developed to deal with functional design of user-machine interfaces .
For example , in information theory , a " signal " is a codified message , that is , the sequence of states in a communication channel that encodes a message .
In the context of signal processing , signals are analog and digital representations of analog physical quantities .
Particularly in digital signal processing , a digital signal may be defined as a sequence of discrete values , typically associated with an underlying continuous-valued physical process .
Although S and S falls under and includes all the topics covered in this article , as well as Analog signal processing and Digital signal processing , it actually is a subset of the field of Mathematical model ing .
Today , the field has become even more daunting and complex with the addition of circuit , systems and signal analysis and design languages and software , from MATLAB and Simulink to NumPy , VHDL , PSpice , Verilog and even Assembly language .

McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence .
John McCarthy is one of the " founding fathers " of artificial intelligence , together with Alan Turing , Marvin Minsky , Allen Newell , and Herbert A. Simon .
In 1966 , McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of chess games with counterparts in the Soviet Union ; McCarthy 's team lost two games and drew two games ( see Kotok-McCarthy ) .
" In 1980 the philosopher John Searle responded with his famous Chinese Room Argument , disagreeing with McCarthy and taking the stance that machines cannot have beliefs simply because they are not conscious .

MM is also the foundation of morphological image processing , which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations .
Mathematical Morphology was developed 1964 by the collaborative work of Georges Matheron and Jean Serra , at the " Ãcole des Mines de Paris " , France .
In 1993 , the first International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology ( ISMM ) took place in Barcelona , Spain .
By combining these operators one can obtain algorithms for many image processing tasks , such as feature extraction , image segmentation , image sharpening , image filtering , and classification .
Some thinkers working in the field of artificial life ( for example Rodney Brooks ) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition .
The idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by philosopher John Searle and mathematician Roger Penrose who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes .
Formal concept analysis finds practical application in fields including data mining , text mining , machine learning , knowledge management , semantic web , software development , chemistry and biology .

Quantization , in mathematics and digital signal processing , is the process of mapping input values from a large set ( often a continuous set ) to output values in a ( countable ) smaller set , often with a finite number of elements .
When the quantization step size ( Î ) is small relative to the variation in the signal being quantized , it is relatively simple to show that the mean squared error produced by such a rounding operation will be approximately math \ Delta ^ 2 / 12 / math.math
This two-stage decomposition applies equally well to vector quantization as well as scalar quantizers .
If it is assumed that distortion is measured by mean squared error , the distortion D , is given by :
Lloyd 's Method I algorithm , originally described in 1957 , can be generalized in a straightforward way for application to vector quantization data .
This generalization results in the Linde-Buzo-Gray ( LBG ) or k-means clustering classifier optimization methods .
( 2005 ) we can differ three different perspectives of text mining , namely text mining as information extraction , text mining as text data mining , and text mining as Data mining ( Knowledge Discovery in Databases ) process.Hotho , A. , NÃ¼rnberger , A. and PaaÃ , G. ( 2005 ) .
High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as pattern recognition .
Typical text mining tasks include text categorization , text clustering , concept / entity extraction , production of granular taxonomies , sentiment analysis , document summarization , and entity relation modeling ( " i.e. " , learning relations between named entity recognition ) .
Text analysis involves information retrieval , lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions , pattern recognition , tagging / annotation , information extraction , data mining techniques including link and association analysis , visualization , and predictive analytics .
The overarching goal is , essentially , to turn text into data for analysis , via application of natural language processing ( NLP ) , different types of algorithm s and analytical methods .
The term text analytics describes a set of linguistic , statistical , and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence , exploratory data analysis , research , or investigation. notably life-sciences research and government intelligence .
Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data ( i.e. , addressing the problem of unstructured data ) , to determine ideas communicated through text ( e.g. , sentiment analysis in social media ) and to support scientific discovery in fields such as the life sciences and bioinformatics .

Generally speaking all learning displays incremental change over time , but describes an Sigmoid function which has different appearances depending on the time scale of observation .
Eurotra was an ambitious machine translation project established and funded by the European Commission from 1978 until 1992 .
The project was unusual in that rather than consisting of a single research team , it had member groups distributed around the member countries , organised along language rather than national lines ( for example , groups in Leuven and Utrecht worked closely together ) , and the secretariat was based at the European Commission in Luxembourg .
While Eurotra never delivered a " working " MT system , the project made a far-reaching long-term impact on the nascent language industries in European member states , in particular among the southern countries of Greece , Italy , Spain , and Portugal .
There is at least one commercial MT system ( developed by an academic / commercial consortium in Denmark ) derived from Eurotra technology .
In signal processing , undersampling or bandpass sampling is a technique where one samples a bandpass -filtered signal at a sample rate below its Nyquist rate ( twice the upper cutoff frequency ) , but is still able to reconstruct the signal .

According to the " MST3K " storyline , Crow - like his fellow robots Tom Servo , Gypsy , and Cambot - was built by Joel Robinson ( Joel Hodgson ) , who created them to help him withstand the torment of watching bad movies on the " Satellite of Love " .
This arose from a gag in episode 203 " Jungle Goddess " following a skit centered on the sitcom " The Honeymooners " , where Joel referred to Crow as " Art Crow " ( in reference to " Honeymooners " co-star Art Carney ) .
Crow was voiced by Trace Beaulieu from the beginning of the series through the end of season seven , and Bill Corbett from the eighth season until the tenth season .
He is voiced by Hampton Yount in the 2017 series revival .
In the earlier seasons of the show , he often announced " Ladies and gentlemen , " Topo Gigio " ! " in the voice of Ed Sullivan .
When Joel Hodgson returned for a guest spot in episode 1001 , " Soultaker " , he offhandedly suggests that Crow " changed his bowling pin " ( that is , his mouth ) .
The book is an expansion of the Jacob Bronowski Memorial Lecture in Natural Philosophy which Sagan gave at the University of Toronto .
He describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk , Slim Pickens , and a character one of his college friends created named " Charlie the sausage-lover .

Another related approach are hidden Markov model s ( HMM ) and it has been shown that the Viterbi algorithm used to search for the most likely path through the HMM is equivalent to stochastic DTW .
On simple control tasks , the NEAT algorithm often arrives at effective networks more quickly than other contemporary neuro-evolutionary techniques and reinforcement learning methods .
In computer science , multiple buffering is the use of more than one buffer to hold a block of data , so that a " reader " will see a complete ( though perhaps old ) version of the data , rather than a partially updated version of the data being created by a " writer " .
Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading bar code d tags or as sophisticated as facial recognition system .
It involves the fields of computer vision or machine vision , and medical imaging , and makes heavy use of pattern recognition , digital geometry , and signal processing .
This field of computer science developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the MIT A.I. Lab , originally as a branch of artificial intelligence and robotics .
2D images are , for example , to be analyzed in computer vision , and 3D images in medical imaging .
The first microcomputer-based image database retrieval system was developed at MIT , in the 1990s , by Banireddy Prasaad , Amar Gupta , Hoo-min Toong , and Stuart Madnick .
A conceptual graph ( CG ) is a formalism for knowledge representation .
In the first published paper on CGs , John F. Sowa applied them to a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence , computer science , and cognitive science .
An eigenface ( The approach of using eigenfaces for Facial recognition system was developed by Sirovich and Kirby ( 1987 ) and used by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland in face classification.Turk , Matthew A and Pentland , Alex P. " Face recognition using eigenfaces " .
Sirovich and Kirby ( 1987 ) showed that principal component analysis could be used on a collection of face images to form a set of basis features .
A set of eigenfaces can be generated by performing a mathematical process called principal component analysis ( PCA ) on a large set of images depicting different human faces .
The technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition is also used outside of face recognition : handwriting recognition , lip reading , voice recognition , sign language / hand gestures interpretation and medical imaging analysis .
Another method similar to the eigenface technique is ' fisherface s ' which uses linear discriminant analysis .Belhumeur , P N , and Hespanha , { J , P } , and Kriegman , D. ' , 1997 .
In mathematical optimization , Dantzig ' s simplex algorithm ( or simplex method ) is a popular algorithm for linear programming .
Other algorithms for solving linear-programming problems are described in the linear programming article .
Linear-fractional programming ( LFP ) is a generalization of linear programming ( LP ) .
These introductions are written for students of computer science and operations research :
An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neuron s , a neural network .
One important and pioneering artificial neural network that used the linear threshold function was the perceptron , developed by Frank Rosenblatt .
The representation of the threshold values as a bias term was introduced by Bernard Widrow in 1960 - see ADALINE .
The possibility of differentiating the activation function allows the direct use of the gradient descent and other optimization algorithms for the adjustment of the weights .
The best known training algorithm called backpropagation has been rediscovered several times but its first development goes back to the work of Paul Werbos .
Crucially , for instance , any multilayer perceptron using a " linear " transfer function has an equivalent single-layer network ; a non-linear function is therefore necessary to gain the advantages of a multi-layer network .
See : Linear transformation , Harmonic analysis , Linear filter , Wavelet , Principal component analysis , Independent component analysis , Deconvolution .
A fairly simple non-linear function , the sigmoid function such as the logistic function also has an easily calculated derivative , which can be important when calculating the weight updates in the network .
It was previously commonly seen in multilayer perceptron s .
The reason is that the gradients computed by the backpropagation algorithm tend to diminish towards zero as activations propagate through layers of sigmoidal neurons , making it difficult to optimize neural networks using multiple layers of sigmoidal neurons .
In bioinformatics , neighbor joining is a bottom-up ( agglomerative ) Cluster analysis method for the creation of phylogenetic trees , created by Naruya Saitou and Masatoshi Nei in 1987 .
Neighbor joining may be viewed as a greedy algorithm for optimizing a tree according to the ' balanced minimum evolution ' ( BME ) criterion .
This makes it practical for analyzing large data sets ( hundreds or thousands of taxa ) and for bootstrapping , for which purposes other means of analysis ( e.g. maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood ) may be computation ally prohibitive .
Question answering ( QA ) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing ( NLP ) , which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language .
SHRDLU was a highly successful question-answering program developed by Terry Winograd in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in computational linguistics , which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering .
One example of such a system was the Unix Consultant ( UC ) , developed by Robert Wilensky at U.C. Berkeley in the late 1980s .
Another project was LILOG , a natural language understanding system that operated on the domain of tourism information in a German city .
In information retrieval , an open domain question answering system aims at returning an answer in response to the user 's question .
The system uses a combination of techniques from computational linguistics , information retrieval and knowledge representation for finding answers .
" part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing techniques can also be used to determine the answer type .
A lexical dictionary such as WordNet can then be used for understanding the context .
Once the question type has been identified , an information retrieval system is used to find a set of documents containing the correct key words .
IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy ! champions , Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin .

The first series of " Robot Wars " was presented by Jeremy Clarkson and co-hosted by Philippa Forrester .
Clarkson left " Robot Wars " after the first series and was replaced with Craig Charles .
When the programme moved to Channel 5 for the seventh series , Forrester did not return for unknown reasons , so Jayne Middlemiss took over the pit reporter duties .
Jonathan Pearce was the show 's commentator throughout its entire run , becoming one of only two people ( the other being judge Noel Sharkey ) to appear in every episode of the programme ; he commentated in the same loud and enthusiastic manner as his football commentaries .
In 2016 , Dara Ã Briain and Angela Scanlon were announced as the hosts of the eighth series , with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator .
All episodes were announced by Jonathan Pearce .

Magnetic ink character recognition code , known in short as MICR code , is a Optical character recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to streamline the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents .
MICR encoded documents can be processed much faster and more accurately than conventional Optical character recognition encoded documents .
The MICR E-13B font has been adopted as the international standard in International Organization for Standardization 1004 : 1995 , and is the standard in Australia , Canada , the United Kingdom , the United States , as well as Central America and much of Asia , besides other countries .
The trial of MICR E13B font was shown to the American Bankers Association ( ABA ) in July 1956 , which adopted it in 1958 as the MICR standard for negotiable document s in the United States .
( May , 1977 ) In 1963 , ANSI adopted the ABA 's E13B font as the American standard for MICR printing , ANSI standard X9.27-1995 and ANSI standard ANS X9.7-1990. and E13B was also standardized as International Organization for Standardization 1004 : 1995 .
The CMC-7 font was developed in France by Groupe Bull in 1957 .
In most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of natural language processing ( NLP ) .
The discipline of information retrieval ( IR ) has developed automatic methods , typically of a statistical flavor , for indexing large document collections and classifying documents .
Another complementary approach is that of natural language processing ( NLP ) which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task .
Tim Berners-Lee , inventor of the world wide web , refers to the existing Internet as the web of " documents " Until this transpires , the web largely consists of unstructured documents lacking semantic metadata .

In computer science , computational learning theory ( or just learning theory ) is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms .
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning .
For example , PAC theory inspired boosting , VC theory led to support vector machine s , and Bayesian inference led to belief networks .
Miller wrote several books and directed the development of WordNet , an online word-linkage database usable by computer programs .
For many years starting from 1986 , Miller directed the development of WordNet , a large computer-readable electronic reference usable in applications such as search engines .
The book was a scientific study of language , emphasizing quantitative data , and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon ' s information theory .
Reviewing the book , Charles E. Osgood classified the book as a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs .
Contemporary usage of " mechanical philosophy " dates back to 1952 and Marie Boas Hall .

However , floating-point numbers have only a certain amount of mathematical precision .
In science fiction , female-appearing robots are often produced for use as domestic servants and sexual slaves , as seen in the film " Westworld " , Paul J. McAuley ' s novel " Fairyland " ( 1995 ) , and Lester del Rey ' s short story " Helen O 'Loy " ( 1938 ) , and sometimes as warriors , killers , or laborers .
The first gynoid in film , the maschinenmensch ( " machine-human " ) , also called " Parody , " " Futura , " " Robotrix , " or the " Maria impersonator , " in Fritz Lang ' s " Metropolis " is also an example : a femininely shaped robot is given skin so that she is not known to be a robot and successfully impersonates the imprisoned Maria and works convincingly as an exotic dancer .
While not truly Artificial intelligence , the fembots still had extremely sophisticated programming that allowed them to pass for human in most situations .
" The 1964 TV series " My Living Doll " features a robot , portrayed by Julie Newmar , who is similarly described .
Jack Halberstam writes that these gynoids inform the viewer that femaleness does not indicate naturalness , and their exaggerated femininity and sexuality is used in a similar way to the title character 's exaggerated masculinity , lampooning stereotypes .
In the film " Westworld " , female robots actually engaged in intercourse with human men as part of the make-believe vacation world human customers paid to attend .

A Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved ( hidden ) states .
HMM models are widely used in speech recognition , for translating a time series of spoken words into text .
Due to limits in computing power , current " in silico " methods usually must trade speed for accuracy ; e.g. , use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculation s .
Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov model .
He is also the creator of several little-known methods such as the trimean and median-median line , an easier alternative to linear regression .
In statistics , exploratory data analysis ( EDA ) is an approach to data analysis data set s to summarize their main characteristics , often with visual methods .
The " S " programming language inspired the systems ' S ' -PLUS and " R " .
This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities , which allowed statisticians to identify outlier s , trends and pattern recognition in data that merited further study .
Many EDA techniques have been adopted into data mining .
The Open University course " Statistics in Society " ( MDST 242 ) , took the above ideas and merged them with Gottfried Noether ' s work , which introduced statistical inference via coin-tossing and the median test .
If we use least squares to fit a function in the form of a hyperplane " Å· " = " a " + " Î² " supT / sup " x " to the data ( " x " sub " i " / sub , " y " sub " i " / sub ) sub 1 â¤ " i " â¤ " n " / sub , we could then assess the fit using the mean squared error ( MSE ) .
In most other regression procedures ( e.g. logistic regression ) , there is no simple formula to compute the expected out-of-sample fit .
For example , for binary classification problems , each case in the validation set is either predicted correctly or incorrectly .
When the value being predicted is continuously distributed , the mean squared error , root mean squared error or median absolute deviation could be used to summarize the errors .
An extreme example of accelerating cross-validation occurs in linear regression , where the results of cross-validation have a closed-form expression known as the " prediction residual error sum of squares " ( PRESS ) .
For example , suppose we are interested in optical character recognition , and we are considering using either support vector machines ( SVM ) or " k " -nearest neighbors ( KNN ) to predict the true character from an image of a handwritten character .

Neuroevolution , or neuro-evolution , is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithm s to generate artificial neural network s ( ANN ) , parameters , topology and rules. and evolutionary robotics .
The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning , which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs .
Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm , and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology .
Many common statistic s , including t-test s , regression models , design of experiments , and much else , use least squares methods applied using linear regression theory , which is based on the quadratic loss function .
Two very commonly used loss functions are the mean squared error , mathL ( a ) = a ^ 2 / math , and the absolute loss , mathL ( a ) = | a | / math .
Software packages like MATLAB , GNU Octave , Scilab , and SciPy provide convenient ways to apply these different methods .

In statistics , an expectation-maximization ( EM ) algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimates of parameter s in statistical model s , where the model depends on unobserved latent variable s .
The EM algorithm is used to find ( local ) maximum likelihood parameters of a statistical model in cases where the equations cannot be solved directly .
If the value of the parameters math \ boldsymbol \ theta / math is known , usually the value of the latent variables math \ mathbf { Z } / math can be found by maximizing the log-likelihood over all possible values of math \ mathbf { Z } / math , either simply by iterating over math \ mathbf { Z } / math or through an algorithm such as the Baum-Welch algorithm for hidden Markov model s .
Other methods exist to find maximum likelihood estimates , such as gradient descent , conjugate gradient , or variants of the Gauss-Newton algorithm .
The EM algorithm can be viewed as two alternating maximization steps , that is , as an example of coordinate descent .
EM is frequently used for data clustering in machine learning and computer vision .

In computational linguistics , lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma of a word based on its intended meaning .
Unlike stemming , lemmatisation depends on correctly identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence , as well as within the larger context surrounding that sentence , such as neighboring sentences or even an entire document .
Lemmatisation is closely related to stemming .
Nonetheless , stemming reduces precision , or true negative rate , for such systems .
Morphological processing of biomedical text can be more effective by a specialised lemmatisation program for biomedicine , and may improve the accuracy of practical information extraction tasks .

Williams , Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks , The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed by his student Alex Krizhevsky { { cite web
Hinton - together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun - are referred to by some as the " Godfathers of AI " and " Godfathers of Deep Learning .
Hinton 's research investigates ways of using neural networks for machine learning , memory , perception and symbol processing .
While Hinton was a professor at Carnegie Mellon University ( 1982-1987 ) , David E. Rumelhart and Hinton and Ronald J. Williams applied the Backpropagation to multi-layer neural networks .
Their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful Knowledge representation of data .
In 2007 Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled " Unsupervised learning of image transformations " .

Behavior-based robotics ( BBR ) or behavioral robotics is an approach in robotics that focuses on robots that are able to exhibit complex-appearing behaviors despite little internal variable state to model its immediate environment , mostly gradually correcting its actions via sensory-motor links .
Classic artificial intelligence typically uses a set of steps to solve problems , it follows a path based on internal representations of events compared to the behavior-based approach .
The school of behavior-based robots owes much to work undertaken in the 1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Rodney Brooks , who with students and colleagues built a series of wheeled and legged robots utilizing the subsumption architecture .
The Tin Woodman , also known as the Tin Man or - mistakenly - the " Tin Woodsman , " is a character in the fictional Land of Oz created by United States author L. Frank Baum .
The Tin Woodman appears in the 2011 TV series " Once Upon a Time " episode " Where Bluebirds Fly " portrayed by Austin Obiajunwa ( as a teenager ) and by Alex DÃ©sert ( as an adult ) .
In statistics and machine learning , classifying certain types of data is a problem for which good algorithms exist that are based on this concept .
Classifying data is a common task in machine learning .
In the case of support vector machine s , a data point is viewed as a " p " -dimensional vector ( a list of " p " numbers ) , and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a ( " p " & minus ; 1 ) -dimensional hyperplane .
A pulse in signal processing is a rapid , transient change in the amplitude of a signal from a baseline value to a higher or lower value , followed by a rapid return to the baseline value.Ãngela Molina , JoaquÃ­n GonzÃ¡lez , " Pulse Voltammetry in Physical Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis " , Springer , 2015 .
In 1979 , Christopher Tyler of Smith-Kettlewell Institute , a student of Julesz and a visual psychophysicist , combined the theories behind single-image wallpaper stereograms and random-dot stereograms ( the work of Julesz and Schilling ) to create the first black-and-white " random-dot autostereogram " ( also known as single-image random-dot stereogram ) with the assistance of computer programmer Maureen Clarke using Apple II and BASIC .Tyler , Christopher W. ( 1983 ) .
The causality of systems also plays an important role in digital signal processing , where filters are constructed so that they are causal , sometimes by altering a non-causal formulation to remove the lack of causality so that it is realizable .
Applications include distributional clustering and dimension reduction , and more recently it has been suggested as a theoretical foundation for deep learning .
For example , in the arts , " Romantic " can refer specifically to a period of Germany poetry roughly from 1780-1810 , but would exclude the later work of Goethe , among other writers .
In music it can mean every composer from Johann Nepomuk Hummel through Rachmaninoff , plus many that came after .
Much long-range comparison work has been from Russian linguists like Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Sergei Starostin .
To explain Lenna 's popularity , David C. Munson , editor-in-chief of " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Transactions on Image Processing " , noted that it was a good test image because of its detail , flat regions , shading , and texture .
A 2012 paper on compressed sensing used a photo of the model Fabio Lanzoni as a test image to draw attention to this issue .
It is a commonly used term in electronics , mathematics , acoustics , and image processing .
Counting zero-crossings is also a method used in speech processing to estimate the fundamental frequency of speech .
In the field of Digital Image Processing , great emphasis is placed on operators which seek out edges within an image .
It is used in automated theorem prover s , inference engine s , proof assistant s , and other artificial intelligence applications .
Backward chaining systems usually employ a depth-first search strategy , e.g. Prolog .
To be specific , the BIBO stability criterion requires that the ROC of the system includes the unit circle .
In mathematics and in signal processing , the Hilbert transform is a specific linear operator that takes a function , " u " ( " t " ) of a real variable and produces another function of a real variable " H " ( " u " ) ( " t " ) .
In signal processing the Hilbert transform of " u " ( " t " ) is commonly denoted by math \ widehat u ( t ) / math ( e.g. , ) .

Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics , data mining and machine learning .
It uses a decision tree ( as a predictive model ) to go from observations about an item ( represented in the branches ) to conclusions about the item 's target value ( represented in the leaves ) .
In data mining , a decision tree describes data ( but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making ) .
This page deals with decision trees in data mining .
In data mining , decision trees can be described also as the combination of mathematical and computational techniques to aid the description , categorization and generalization of a given set of data .
Decision trees used in data mining are of two main types :
Information gain is based on the concept of entropy and information content from information theory .
Examples include Salford Systems CART ( which licensed the proprietary code of the original CART authors ) , IBM SPSS Modeler , RapidMiner , SAS Enterprise Miner , Matlab , R ( an open-source software environment for statistical computing , which includes several CART implementations such as rpart , party and randomForest packages ) , Weka ( a free and open-source data-mining suite , contains many decision tree algorithms ) , Orange , KNIME , Microsoft SQL Server programming language ) .
Sequential pattern mining discovers subsequences that are common to more than minsup sequences in a sequence database , where minsup is set by the user .
Advanced gene finders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes typically use complex probabilistic model s , such as hidden Markov model s ( HMMs ) to combine information from a variety of different signal and content measurements .
The SNAP gene finder is HMM-based like Genscan , and attempts to be more adaptable to different organisms , addressing problems related to using a gene finder on a genome sequence that it was not trained against. also use machine learning techniques like support vector machines for successful gene prediction .
Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition .
FragGeneScan and MetaGeneAnnotator are popular gene prediction programs based on Hidden Markov model .
Data analysis such as regression or classification can be done in the reduced space more accurately than in the original space .
The data transformation may be linear , as in principal component analysis ( PCA ) , but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist.Samet , H. ( 2006 ) " Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data Structures " .
A different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the use of autoencoder s , a special kind of feed-forward neural network s with a bottle-neck hidden layer.Hongbing Hu , Stephen A. Zahorian , ( 2010 ) .
The underlying theory is close to the support vector machine s ( SVM ) insofar as the GDA method provides a mapping of the input vectors into high-dimensional feature space .
For high-dimensional datasets ( i.e. with number of dimensions more than 10 ) , dimension reduction is usually performed prior to applying a K-nearest neighbors algorithm ( k-NN ) in order to avoid the effects of the curse of dimensionality .Kevin Beyer , Jonathan Goldstein , Raghu Ramakrishnan , Uri Shaft ( 1999 ) .
Feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step using principal component analysis ( PCA ) , linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) , canonical correlation analysis ( CCA ) , or non-negative matrix factorization ( NMF ) techniques as a pre-processing step followed by clustering by K-NN on feature vectors in reduced-dimension space .
In machine learning this process is also called low-dimensional embedding .
Applications are digital image processing ( e.g. , blurring effects , skeletonizing ) , motion planning in robotics , and even pathfinding .

There are two general approaches to automatic summarization : Information extraction and abstraction .
Such transformation , however , is computationally much more challenging than extraction , involving both natural language processing and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge .
Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document , while others can use multiple source documents ( for example , a cluster analysis of articles on the same topic ) .
" Abstraction requires a deep natural language understanding , which makes it difficult for a computer system .
They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary , improve information retrieval ( if documents have keyphrases assigned , a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a full-text search ) , and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus .
Some classifiers make a binary classification for a test example , while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase .
Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used , such as decision trees , Naive Bayes , and rule induction .
In the case of Turney 's GenEx algorithm , a genetic algorithm is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm .
TextRank is a general purpose graph -based ranking algorithm for natural language processing .
The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE ( Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation ) measure .

The system was based on a hybrid system using a naive Bayes classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience .
For example , a simple greedy algorithm admits a constant factor guarantee.Nemhauser , George L. , Laurence A. Wolsey , and Marshall L. Fisher .
One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences , in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks , is the ROUGE metric ( Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation , In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems ( NIPS ) , Montreal , Canada , December - 2014 .
Machine translation can use a method based on dictionary entries , which means that the words will be translated as a dictionary does - word by word , usually without much correlation of meaning between them .

The company 's main focus was bringing speech recognition solutions to phone systems .
When the number of clusters is fixed to " k " , k-means clustering gives a formal definition as an optimization problem : find the " k " cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center , such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized .
Variations of " k " -means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs , but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set ( " k " -medoids ) , choosing median s ( " k " -medians clustering ) , choosing the initial centers less randomly ( " k " -means + + ) or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment ( fuzzy c-means ) .
Second , it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification , and as such is popular in machine learning .
If the objective function " f " is linear and the constrained space is a polytope , the problem is a linear programming problem , which may be solved using well-known linear programming techniques such as the simplex method .
If the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear , quadratic programming techniques are used .
Latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) is a technique in natural language processing , in particular distributional semantics , of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms .
Synonymy and polysemy are fundamental problems in natural language processing :
The SVD is typically computed using large matrix methods ( for example , Lanczos method s ) but may also be computed incrementally and with greatly reduced resources via a neural network -like approach , which does not require the large , full-rank matrix to be held in memory .
" RBM 500.3 ( 2007 ) : 500. documents are mapped to memory addresses by means of a neural network in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses .
Deep learning essentially builds a graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents .
LSI helps overcome synonymy by increasing recall , one of the most problematic constraints of Boolean keyword queries and vector space models .
Note that this rank reduction is essentially the same as doing Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) on the matrix A , except that PCA subtracts off the means .
Due to its cross-domain applications in Information Retrieval , Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) , Cognitive Science and Computational Linguistics , LSA has been implemented to support many different kinds of applications .

Once performed by hand , POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics , using algorithms which associate discrete terms , as well as hidden parts of speech , by a set of descriptive tags .
For some time , part-of-speech tagging was considered an inseparable part of natural language processing , because there are certain cases where the correct part of speech cannot be decided without understanding the semantics or even the pragmatics of the context .
In the mid-1980s , researchers in Europe began to use hidden Markov model s ( HMMs ) to disambiguate parts of speech , when working to tag the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus of British English .
Hidden Markov model and Markov model taggers can both be implemented using the Viterbi algorithm .
Many machine learning methods have also been applied to the problem of POS tagging .

The first appearance of the Terminator was as the eponymous antagonist in " The Terminator " , a 1984 film directed and co-written by James Cameron .
Roland Kickinger was cast as the principal actor but CGI was used to superimpose Schwarzenegger 's face from the original 1984 film .
The Model 101 is sent back in time to terminate a single target , Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton ) , in 1984 , to prevent the birth of her son , John , the future leader of the Human Resistance .
A Model 101 is captured by the resistance , reprogrammed by the future John Connor ( Michael Edwards ) , and sent back to the 1990s to protect young John ( Edward Furlong ) from a T-1000 ( Robert Patrick ) dispatched to kill him .
In the third film , a T-101 Terminator portrayed by Schwarzenegger is reprogrammed to protect John Connor ( Nick Stahl ) , as well as his future wife Kate Brewster ( Claire Danes ) , from a T-X ( Kristanna Loken ) .
As the very first T-800 activated in this timeline , it engages John Connor ( Christian Bale ) in battle during John 's attempt to rescue Kyle Reese ( Anton Yelchin ) from the Skynet base in San Francisco .
As John begins planting hydrogen fuel cells , cyborg prototype Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) arrives to stall the T-800 , able to match its strength due to his own metal endoskeleton , but due to Marcus harbouring biological organs , specifically his human heart , the T-800 is able to incapacitate him long enough to stab John through the abdomen from behind , wounding him .
In the film , a T-800 was reprogrammed by an unknown party from a point in time further in the future , and sent to 1973 to protect nine-year-old Sarah Connor ( Emilia Clarke ) from a T-1000 sent to kill her and her parents .
After Kyle Reese 's ( Jai Courtney ) arrival in 1984 , the trio defeat the T-1000 ( Lee Byung-hun ) together .
Later , in 2017 , they battle John Connor ( Jason Clarke ) , who has been transformed into a T-3000 tasked to ensure Skynet 's rise .
With both the original T-800 's and the T-1000 's remains destroyed in 1984 and the older Terminator 's existence concealed , Cyberdyne Systems lacks the Skynet technology to work with for decades until John Connor is under Miles Dyson 's ( Courtney B.

In computer vision , document layout analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing the regions of interest in the scanned image of a text document .
It is typically performed before a document image is sent to an Optical character recognition engine , but it can be used also to detect duplicate copies of the same document in large archives , or to index documents by their structure or pictorial content .
Document layout is formally defined in the international standard International Organization for Standardization 8613-1 : 1989 .
It is a common assumption in both document layout analysis algorithms and optical character recognition algorithms that the characters in the document image are oriented so that text lines are horizontal .

Notably , any distribution of points around a cluster ( see K-means clustering ) may be accurately given enough Gaussian components , but scarcely over " K " = 20 components are needed to accurately model a given image distribution or cluster of data .
In image processing and computer vision , traditional image segmentation models often assign to one pixel only one exclusive pattern .
Probabilistic mixture models such as Gaussian mixture model s ( GMM ) are used to resolve point set registration problems in image processing and computer vision fields .
This is a particular way of implementing maximum likelihood estimation for this problem .
The resulting model is termed a hidden Markov model and is one of the most common sequential hierarchical models .
Subsequent works focused on addressing these problems , but it was not until the advent of the modern computer and the popularisation of Maximum Likelihood ( MLE ) parameterisation techniques that research really took off .

Fitness functions and selection environments ( called training datasets in machine learning ) are the two facets of fitness and are therefore intricately connected .
The first type of problem goes by the name of regression ; the second is known as classification , with logistic regression as a special case where , besides the crisp classifications like " Yes " or " No , " a probability is also attached to each outcome ; and the last one is related to Boolean algebra and logic synthesis .
Such functions include the mean squared error , root mean squared error , mean absolute error , relative squared error , root relative squared error , relative absolute error , and others .
The design of fitness functions for classification and logistic regression takes advantage of three different characteristics of classification models .
The counts of TP , TN , FP , and FN are usually kept on a table known as the confusion matrix .
Some popular fitness functions based on the confusion matrix include sensitivity / specificity , recall / precision , F-measure , Jaccard similarity , Matthews correlation coefficient , and cost / gain matrix which combines the costs and gains assigned to the 4 different types of classifications .
For instance , one can combine some measure based on the confusion matrix with the mean squared error evaluated between the raw model outputs and the actual values .
Or combine the F-measure with the R-square evaluated for the raw model output and the target ; or the cost / gain matrix with the correlation coefficient , and so on .
More exotic fitness functions that explore model granularity include the area under the ROC curve and rank measure .
Also related to this new dimension of classification models , is the idea of assigning probabilities to the model output , which is what is done in logistic regression .
Then it is also possible to use these probabilities and evaluate the mean squared error ( or some other similar measure ) between the probabilities and the actual values , then combine this with the confusion matrix to create very efficient fitness functions for logistic regression .
Popular examples of fitness functions based on the probabilities include maximum likelihood estimation and hinge loss .
So , GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in logistic regression , classification , and regression .

In machine learning and statistics , classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories ( sub-populations ) a new observation belongs , on the basis of a training set of data containing observations ( or instances ) whose category membership is known .
Classification is an example of pattern recognition .
In the terminology of machine learning , classification is considered an instance of supervised learning , i.e. , learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available .
The corresponding unsupervised learning procedure is known as cluster analysis , and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance .
In statistics , where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure , the properties of observations are termed explanatory variable s ( or independent variable s , regressors , etc .
In machine learning , the observations are often known as " instances " , the explanatory variables are termed " features " ( grouped into a feature vector ) , and the possible categories to be predicted are " classes " .
Other fields may use different terminology : e.g. in community ecology , the term " classification " normally refers to cluster analysis , i.e. , a type of unsupervised learning , rather than the supervised learning described in this article .
Classification and clustering are examples of the more general problem of pattern recognition , which is the assignment of some sort of output value to a given input value .
Classification can be thought of as two separate problems - binary classification and multiclass classification .

AdaBoost , short for " Adaptive Boosting " , is a machine learning meta-algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire , who won the 2003 GÃ¶del Prize for their work .
Every learning algorithm tends to suit some problem types better than others , and typically has many different parameters and configurations to adjust before it achieves optimal performance on a dataset , AdaBoost ( with Decision tree learning as the weak learners ) is often referred to as the best out-of-the-box classifier .
Unlike neural network s and Support vector machine , the AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model , reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time as irrelevant features need not be computed .
Thus AdaBoost algorithms perform either gradient descent ( find mathh ( x ) / math with the steepest gradient , choose math \ alpha / math to minimize test error ) or Newton ( choose some target point , find math \ alpha h ( x ) / math that brings mathF _ t / math closest to that point ) optimization of training error .
LogitBoost represents an application of established logistic regression techniques to the AdaBoost method .
This can be accomplished by backfitting , linear programming or some other method .
Automatic number-plate recognition ( ANPR ; see also other names below ) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plate s to create vehicle location data .
ANPR uses optical character recognition ( OCR ) on images taken by cameras .
Vehicle registration plates in Saudi Arabia use white background , but several vehicle types may have a different background .
The Home Office states the purpose of automatic number-plate recognition in the United Kingdom is to help detect , deter and disrupt criminality including tackling organised crime groups and terrorists .
Transport for London ( TfL ) uses ANPR systems and charges motorists a daily fee of Â£ 11.50 if they enter , leave or move around within the congestion charge zone between 7 a.m. and 6 : 00 p.m. , Monday to Friday .
John Searle ( 1999 , pp. 85 ) stresses that " competence " in predicting / explaining human behaviour involves being able to both recognize others as " " intentional " " beings , and interpret others ' minds as having " intentional states " ( e.g. , beliefs and desires ) :
Behaviorists following Wundt , Edward Thorndike , Watson , and others rejected introspective reports as data for an objective science of psychology .
The ' poster child ' of this oppositional stance is a thought experiment ( Gedankenexperiment ) called Searle 's Chinese Room ( SCR ) , named after its inventor , philosopher John Searle .
LTP has received much support since it was first observed by Terje LÃ¸mo in 1966 and is still the subject of many modern studies and clinical research .
His other interests include temporal reasoning , event semantics , spatial language , language annotation , computational linguistics , and machine learning .

Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation .
A Nyquist plot is a parametric plot of a frequency response used in automatic control and signal processing .
For a computer vision system analysing an unknown scene , there is no way to know a priori what scales are appropriate for describing the interesting structures in the image data .
This overall framework has been applied to a large variety of problems in computer vision , including feature detection , feature classification , image segmentation , image matching , motion estimation , computation of shape cues and object recognition .
Recent work has shown that also more complex operations , such as scale-invariant object recognition can be performed in this way ,
Derived from feedforward neural networks , RNNs can use their internal state ( memory ) to process variable length sequences of inputs .
Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory , and are part of long short-term memory networks ( LSTMs ) and gated recurrent unit s .
Long short-term memory ( LSTM ) networks were invented by Sepp Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber in 1997 and set accuracy records in multiple applications domains .
Around 2007 , LSTM started to revolutionize speech recognition , outperforming traditional models in certain speech applications .
LSTM broke records for improved machine translation ,
For supervised learning in discrete time settings , sequences of real-valued input vectors arrive at the input nodes , one vector at a time .
In reinforcement learning settings , no teacher provides target signals .
Michael I. Jordan networks are similar to Elman networks .
Long short-term memory ( LSTM ) is a deep learning system that avoids the vanishing gradient problem .
LSTM can learn to recognize context-sensitive languages unlike previous models based on hidden Markov model s ( HMM ) and similar concepts .
The combined system is analogous to a Turing machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable end-to-end , allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent .
Greg Snider of HP Labs describes a system of cortical computing with memristive nanodevices .
Various methods for doing so were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s by Werbos , Williams , Robinson , JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber , Sepp Hochreiter , Pearlmutter and others .
The standard method is called " backpropagation through time " or BPTT , and is a generalization of back-propagation for feed-forward networks. which is an instance of automatic differentiation in the forward accumulation mode with stacked tangent vectors .
The most common global optimization method for training RNNs is genetic algorithm s , especially in unstructured networks .
As such , it is different from its descendant : recurrent neural network s .
The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised .
It calculates the errors between calculated output and sample output data , and uses this to create an adjustment to the weights , thus implementing a form of gradient descent .
Single-layer perceptrons are only capable of learning linearly separable patterns ; in 1969 in a famous monograph entitled " Perceptrons " , Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert showed that it was impossible for a single-layer perceptron network to learn an XOR function ( nonetheless , it was known that multi-layer perceptrons are capable of producing any possible boolean function ) .
With this choice , the single-layer network is identical to the logistic regression model , widely used in statistical model ing .
The logistic function is also known as the sigmoid function .
It has a continuous derivative , which allows it to be used in backpropagation .
In many applications the units of these networks apply a " sigmoid function " as an activation function .
Multi-layer networks use a variety of learning techniques , the most popular being " back-propagation " .
To adjust weights properly , one applies a general method for non-linear optimization that is called gradient descent .
Today there are practical methods ! -- examples ? -- that make back-propagation in multi-layer perceptrons the tool of choice for many machine learning tasks .
Various activation functions can be used , and there can be relations between weights , as in convolutional neural network s .
It has a rich set of features , libraries for constraint logic programming , multithreading , unit testing , GUI , interfacing to Java , ODBC and others , literate programming , a web server , SGML , RDF , RDFS , developer tools ( including an IDE with a GUI debugger and GUI profiler ) , and extensive documentation .

Neural network research stagnated after the publication of machine learning research by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert ( 1969 ) .
Also key in later advances was the backpropagation algorithm which effectively solved the exclusive-or problem ( Werbos 1975 ) .
They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to Pattern recognition in data .
One classical type of artificial neural network is the recurrent neural network Hopfield network .
The concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by Alan Turing in his 1948 paper " Intelligent Machinery " in which called them " B-type unorganised machines .
Unsupervised neural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution , e.g. , see the Boltzmann machine ( 1983 ) , and more recently , deep learning algorithms , which can implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data .
To gain this understanding , neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes ( data ) , biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning ( biological neural network models ) and theory ( statistical learning theory and information theory ) .
Between 2009 and 2012 , the recurrent neural network s and deep feedforward neural network s developed in the research group of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning .
Variants of the back-propagation algorithm as well as unsupervised methods by Geoff Hinton and colleagues at the University of Toronto can be used to train deep , highly nonlinear neural architectures , { { cite journal

Typical Brill taggers use a few hundred rules , which may be developed by linguistic intuition or by machine learning on a pre-tagged corpus .
In information theory , the cross entropy between two probability distribution s mathp / math and mathq / math over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bit s needed to identify an event drawn from the set if a coding scheme used for the set is optimized for an estimated probability distribution mathq / math , rather than the true distribution mathp / math .
An example is language model ing , where a model is created based on a training set mathT / math , and then its cross-entropy is measured on a test set to assess how accurate the model is in predicting the test data .
Cross entropy can be used to define a loss function in machine learning and optimization .
More specifically , consider logistic regression , which ( among other things ) can be used to classify observations into two possible classes ( often simply labelled math0 / math and math1 / math ) .
where the vector of weights math \ mathbf { w } / math is optimized through some appropriate algorithm such as gradient descent .

In information retrieval , tf-idf or TFIDF , short for term frequency-inverse document frequency , is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus .
It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval , text mining , and user modeling .
Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engine s as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document 's relevance given a user Information retrieval .
tf-idf can be successfully used for stop-words filtering in various subject fields , including automatic summarization and classification .
Karen SpÃ¤rck Jones ( 1972 ) conceived a statistical interpretation of term-specificity called Inverse Document Frequency ( idf ) , which became a cornerstone of term weighting :
Idf was introduced , as " term specificity , " by Karen SpÃ¤rck Jones in a 1972 paper .
Although it has worked well as a heuristic , its theoretical foundations have been troublesome for at least three decades afterward , with many researchers trying to find information theory justifications for it .
The Term Frequency and the Inverse Document Frequency can be formulated using Information theory ; it helps to understand why their product have a meaning in terms of joint informational content of a document .

A voice-user interface ( VUI ) makes spoken human interaction with computers possible , using speech recognition to understand spoken commands and Question answering , and typically text to speech to play a reply .
Until recently , this area was considered to be artificial intelligence .
Designing a good VUI requires interdisciplinary talents of computer science , linguistics and human factors psychology - all of which are skills that are expensive and hard to come by .
Such applications should streamline the call flows , minimize prompts , eliminate unnecessary iterations and allow elaborate " mixed initiative dialog system , " which enable callers to enter several pieces of information in a single utterance and in any order or combination .
In 2007 , a CNN business article reported that voice command was over a billion dollar industry and that companies like Google and .
The iPhone 4S , iPad 3 , iPad Mini 1G , iPad Air , iPad Pro 1G , iPod Touch 5G and later , all come with a more advanced voice assistant called Siri .
While speech recognition technology has improved considerably in recent years , voice user interfaces still suffer from parsing or transcription errors in which a user 's speech is not interpreted correctly .
Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution , named-entity recognition , information retrieval , and dialog management .
Therefore , accurate speech recognition , along with some degree of artificial intelligence on the part of the machine associated with the VUI , would be required .

A distinction is usually made between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world , such as nowikidog / nowiki and nowikitail / nowiki and the more complex " symbols " that are present in a machine like a neural network .
Two lines of evidence suggested to Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that " symbol manipulation " was the essence of both human and machine intelligence : the development of artificial intelligence programs and psychological experiments on human beings .
First , in the early decades of AI research there were a number of very successful programs that used high level symbol processing , such as Newell and Herbert A. Simon ' s General Problem Solver or Terry Winograd ' s SHRDLU .
John Searle ' s Chinese room argument , presented in 1980 , attempted to show that a program ( or any physical symbol system ) could not be said to " understand " the symbols that it uses ; that the symbols themselves have no meaning or semantic content , and so the machine can never be truly intelligent from symbol manipulation alone .
In the middle eighties , Rodney Brooks of MIT was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all .
Brooks ( and others , such as Hans Moravec ) discovered that our most basic skills of motion , survival , perception , balance and so on did not seem to require high level symbols at all , that in fact , the use of high level symbols was more complicated and less successful .
Astrid M. Rosenthal-von der PÃ¼tten of University of Duisburg-Essen conducted research on how characteristics of robots determine responses from humans through an online web poll .

CRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases :
While competing methods such as gradient descent for constrained optimization require a projection step back to the feasible set in each iteration , the Frank-Wolfe algorithm only needs the solution of a linear problem over the same set in each iteration , and automatically stays in the feasible set .
The iterates of the algorithm can always be represented as a sparse convex combination of the extreme points of the feasible set , which has helped to the popularity of the algorithm for sparse greedy optimization in machine learning and signal processing problems ,
If the feasible set is given by a set of linear constraints , then the subproblem to be solved in each iteration becomes a linear programming .
A production system ( or production rule system ) is a computer program typically used to provide some form of artificial intelligence , which consists primarily of a set of rules about behavior but it also includes the mechanism necessary to follow those rules as the system responds to states of the world .

In statistical analysis of binary classification , the Fsub1 / sub score ( also F-score or F-measure ) is a measure of a test 's accuracy .
It considers both the precision " p " and the recall " r " of the test to compute the score : " p " is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier , and " r " is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples ( all samples that should have been identified as positive ) .
This is related to the field of binary classification where recall is often termed " sensitivity .
The F-score is often used in the field of information retrieval for measuring search , document classification , and query classification performance. and so mathF _ \ beta / math is seen in wide application .
The F-score is also used in machine learning .See , e.g. , the evaluation of the may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier .
The F-score has been widely used in the natural language processing literature , such as the evaluation of named entity recognition and word segmentation .

Another common model for overdispersion - when some of the observations are not Bernoulli - arises from introducing a normal random variable into a logistic regression .
In this case , if the variance of the normal variable is zero , the model reduces to the standard ( undispersed ) logistic regression .
In mathematics , a Relevance Vector Machine ( RVM ) is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and probabilistic classification .
The RVM has an identical functional form to the support vector machine , but provides probabilistic classification .
Compared to that of support vector machine s ( SVM ) , the Bayesian formulation of the RVM avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM ( that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations ) .
This is unlike the standard sequential minimal optimization ( SMO ) -based algorithms employed by Support vector machine s , which are guaranteed to find a global optimum ( of the convex problem ) .

Apertium is a shallow-transfer machine translation system , which uses finite state transducer s for all of its lexical transformations , and hidden Markov model s for part-of-speech tagging or word category disambiguation .
Existing machine translation systems available at present are mostly commercial or use proprietary technologies , which makes them very hard to adapt to new usages ; furthermore , they use different technologies across language pairs , which makes it very difficult , for instance , to integrate them in a single multilingual content management system .
Apertium originated as one of the machine translation engines in the project OpenTrad , which was funded by the Spain government , and developed by the Transducens research group at the University of Alicante .
Speech segmentation is a subfield of general speech perception and an important subproblem of the technologically focused field of speech recognition , and cannot be adequately solved in isolation .
As in most natural language processing problems , one must take into account context , grammar , and semantics , and even so the result is often a probabilistic division ( statistically based on likelihood ) rather than a categorical one .
This problem overlaps to some extent with the problem of text segmentation that occurs in some languages which are traditionally written without inter-word spaces , like Chinese and Japanese , compared to writing system s which indicate speech segmentation between words by a word divider , such as the space .
Word Boundary Identification can be overcome by Natural language understanding approaches such as ( RRG ) for languages without spaces between words such as Japanese and Chinese .
" An often-used example in the literature of speech recognition .
Lexical recognition is of particular value in the field of computer speech recognition , since the ability to build and search a network of semantically connected ideas would greatly increase the effectiveness of speech-recognition software .
Compare speech segmentation , the process of dividing speech into linguistically meaningful portions .
The Unicode Consortium has published a " Standard Annex on Text Segmentation " , exploring the issues of segmentation in multiscript texts .
While the first is a simple machine learning of a specific text , the latter case implies that a document may contain multiple topics , and the task of computerized text segmentation may be to discover these topics automatically and segment the text accordingly .
Segmenting the text into topic s or discourse turns might be useful in some natural processing tasks : it can improve information retrieval or speech recognition significantly ( by indexing / recognizing documents more precisely or by giving the specific part of a document corresponding to the query as a result ) .
Automatic segmentation is the problem in natural language processing of implementing a computer process to segment text .

NeuroSolutions is a neural network development environment developed by NeuroDimension .
The software is used to design , train and deploy neural network ( supervised learning and unsupervised learning ) models to perform a wide variety of tasks such as data mining , classification , function approximation , multivariate regression and time-series prediction .
NeuroSolutions provides three separate wizards for automatically building neural network models :
The Data Manager module allows the user to import data from Microsoft Access , Microsoft Excel or text files and perform various preprocessing and data analysis operations .
From the Data Manager , the user can load the data directly into a NeuroSolutions breadboard or use the data to create a new neural network .
The NeuralBuilder centers the design specifications on the specific neural network architecture the user wishes to build .
Once the neural network architecture is selected , the user can customize parameters such as the number of hidden layers , the number of processing elements and the learning algorithm .
If the user is unsure what the parameters should be set to , a genetic algorithm can be used to optimize the settings .
The NeuralExpert centers the design specifications around the type of problem the user would like the neural network to solve ( Classification , Prediction , Function approximation or Cluster analysis ) .
Given this problem type and the size of the user 's data set , the NeuralExpert intelligently selects the neural network size and architecture that will likely produce a good solution .
NeuroSolutions can automatically generate C + + source code for a neural network designed within its graphical user interface .
This provides the flexibility to customize the neural network code for the particular application .
Since the generated code is ANSI -compliant , the user can deploy the neural network solution to other platforms such as UNIX .
The Custom Solution Wizard is an optional add-on product that will take a neural network designed within NeuroSolutions and encapsulate it into a dynamic link library ( DLL ) that conforms to a simple protocol .

In statistics , multinomial logistic regression is a classification method that generalizes logistic regression to multiclass classification , i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes .
As with other types of regression , there is no need for the independent variables to be statistically independent from each other ( unlike , for example , in a naive Bayes classifier ) ; however , collinearity is assumed to be relatively low , as it becomes difficult to differentiate between the impact of several variables if this is not the case .
The article on logistic regression presents a number of equivalent formulations of simple logistic regression , and many of these have analogues in the multinomial logit model .
The difference between the multinomial logit model and numerous other methods , models , algorithms , etc. with the same basic setup ( the perceptron algorithm , support vector machine s , linear discriminant analysis , etc .
The basic setup is the same as in logistic regression , the only difference being that the dependent variable s are categorical rather than binary , i.e. there are " K " possible outcomes rather than just two .
The following description is somewhat shortened ; for more details , consult the logistic regression article .
As explained in the logistic regression article , the regression coefficients and explanatory variables are normally grouped into vectors of size " M + 1 " , so that the predictor function can be written more compactly :
The unknown parameters in each vector " Î²subk / sub " are typically jointly estimated by maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimation , which is an extension of maximum likelihood using regularization of the weights to prevent pathological solutions ( usually a squared regularizing function , which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution on the weights , but other distributions are also possible ) .
In natural language processing , multinomial LR classifiers are commonly used as an alternative to naive Bayes classifier s because they do not assume statistical independence of the random variables ( commonly known as " features " ) that serve as predictors .
Euler Math Toolbox uses a matrix language similar to MATLAB , a system that had been under development since the 1970s .

One source for the philosophy of information can be found in the technical work of Norbert Wiener , Alan Turing ( though his work has a wholly different origin and theoretical framework ) , William Ross Ashby , Claude Shannon , Warren Weaver , and many other scientists working on computing and information theory back in the early 1950s .
Recent creative advances and efforts in computing , such as semantic web , ontology engineering , knowledge engineering , and modern artificial intelligence provide philosophy with fertile ideas , new and evolving subject matters , methodologies , and models for philosophical inquiry .
While computer science brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies , and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy , further major progress in computer science would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics , software engineering , knowledge engineering , and ontologies .
Classical topics in philosophy , namely , mind , consciousness , experience , reasoning , knowledge , truth , morality and creativity are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in computer science , e.g. , in areas such as agent computing , software agents , and intelligent mobile agent technologies .
The technique was introduced by Wim Sweldens .
She serves as a member of the National Academy of Sciences ( since 2005 ) , American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( since 2009 ) ,
The idea behind statistical machine translation comes from information theory .
This trade-off between quality and time usage can also be found in speech recognition .
The statistical translation models were initially word based ( Models 1-5 from IBM Hidden Markov model from Stephan VogelS .
A language model is an essential component of any statistical machine translation system , which aids in making the translation as fluent as possible .
In speech recognition , the speech signal and the corresponding textual representation can be mapped to each other in blocks in order .
A built-in speech recognition system recognizes the speech and the recognition results are edited by an online system .
Recent years have seen a growing interest in combining speech recognition , machine translation and speech synthesis .
Bitext word alignment or simply word alignment is the natural language processing task of identifying translation relationships among the words ( or more rarely multiword units ) in a bitext , resulting in a bipartite graph between the two sides of the bitext , with an arc between two words if and only if they are translations of one another .
Bitext word alignment is an important supporting task for most methods of statistical machine translation .
This approach to training is an instance of unsupervised learning , in that the system is not given examples of the kind of output desired , but is trying to find values for the unobserved model and alignments which best explain the observed bitext .
Besides the training of machine translation systems , other applications of word alignment include translation lexicon induction , word sense discovery , word sense disambiguation and the cross-lingual projection of linguistic information .
The IBM models are used in Statistical machine translation to train a translation model and an alignment model .
Jelinek was born in Czechoslovakia just before the outbreak of World War II and emigrated with his family to the United States in the early years of the communist regime .
He met with his old friend MiloÅ¡ Forman , who introduced him to film student Milena Tabolova whose screenplay had been the basis for the movie " Easy Life " ( " SnadnÃ½ Å¾ivot " ) .

In natural language processing , the latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar .
LDA is an example of a topic model and belongs to the machine learning toolbox and in wider sense to the artificial intelligence toolbox .
In the context of machine learning , where it is most widely applied today , LDA was rediscovered independently by David Blei , Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan in 2003 , and presented as a graphical model for topic discovery .
Topic modeling is a classic solution to the problem of information retrieval using linked data and semantic web technology .
Related models and techniques are , among others , latent semantic indexing , independent component analysis , probabilistic latent semantic indexing , non-negative matrix factorization , and Gamma-Poisson distribution .

Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one natural language to another .
Interest grew in statistical machine translation , which became more common and also less expensive in the 1980s as available computational power increased .
Several of these programs are available online , such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers AltaVista 's BabelFish ( now Yahoo 's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008 ) .
The first set of proposals for computer based machine translation was presented in 1949 by Warren Weaver , a researcher at the Rockefeller Foundation , " Translation memorandum .
" These proposals were based on information theory , successes in code breaking during the Second World War , and theories about the universal principles underlying natural language .
Research in the 1960s in both the Soviet Union and the United States concentrated mainly on the Russian-English language pair .
The publication of the report had a profound impact on research into machine translation in the United States , and to a lesser extent the Soviet Union and United Kingdom .
Systems were also brought onto the market in China , Eastern Europe , Korea , and the Soviet Union .
During the 1990s , encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis , research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project .
Currently a large amount of research is being done into statistical machine translation and example-based machine translation .

Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test , also known in statistics as a classification function , that are widely used in medicine :
The values of sensitivity and specificity are agnostic to the percent of positive cases in the population of interest ( as opposed to , for example , precision ) .
The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2 Ã 2 " contingency table " or " confusion matrix " , as follows :
Sensitivity is not the same as the precision or positive predictive value ( ratio of true positives to combined true and false positives ) , which is as much a statement about the proportion of actual positives in the population being tested as it is about the test .
In information retrieval , the positive predictive value is called precision , and sensitivity is called recall .

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner .
An " autoencoder " is a neural network that learns to copy its input to its output .
Here , math \ sigma / math is an element-wise activation function such as a sigmoid function or a rectified linear unit .
Weights and biases are usually initialized randomly , and then updated iteratively during training through Backpropagation .
Autoencoders are trained to minimise reconstruction errors ( such as Mean squared error ) , often referred to as the " loss " :
As mentioned before , the training of an autoencoder is performed through Backpropagation , just like a regular feedforward neural network .
However , experimental results have shown that autoencoders might still feature learning in these cases .
) autoencoders , Variational autoencoders ( VAEs ) are generative model s , like Generative adversarial network .
Geoffrey Hinton developed a pretraining technique for training many-layered deep autoencoders .
One milestone paper on the subject was that of Geoffrey Hinton with his publication in Science Magazine in 2006 :
If linear activations are used , or only a single sigmoid hidden layer , then the optimal solution to an autoencoder is strongly related to principal component analysis ( PCA ) .
Information retrieval benefits particularly from dimensionality reduction in that search can become extremely efficient in certain kinds of low dimensional spaces .
Autoencoders were indeed applied to semantic hashing , proposed by Salakhutdinov and Geoffrey Hinton in 2007 .
Autoencoder has been successfully applied to the machine translation of human languages which is usually referred to as neural machine translation ( NMT ) .
In computer vision , blob detection methods are aimed at detecting regions in a digital image that differ in properties , such as brightness or color , compared to surrounding regions .
These regions could signal the presence of objects or parts of objects in the image domain with application to object recognition and / or object video tracking .
This in practice highly useful property implies that besides the specific topic of Laplacian blob detection , " local maxima / minima of the scale-normalized Laplacian are also used for scale selection in other contexts " , such as in corner detection , scale-adaptive feature tracking ( Bretzner and Lindeberg 1998 ) , in the scale-invariant feature transform ( Lowe 2004 ) as well as other image descriptors for image matching and object recognition .
In the area of computer vision , this idea has been used for defining affine invariant interest point operators as well as affine invariant texture analysis methods .

A more general problem is that , as Steven Pinker ( 1995 ) notes , almost every sentence anybody voices is an original combination of words , never previously uttered , therefore a language cannot consist only of word combinations learned through repetition and conditioning ; the brain must contain innate means of creating endless amounts of grammatical sentences from a limited vocabulary .
Although Stephen Krashen ( 1975 ) also criticises this theory , he does not deny the importance of age for second-language acquisition .
The term " language acquisition " became commonly used after Stephen Krashen contrasted it with formal and non-constructive " learning .
For example , Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom argue that because a language is a complex design that serves a specific function that cannot be replaced by any other existing capacity , the trait of language acquisition can be attributed to natural selection .

A popular application for serial robots in today 's industry is the pick-and-place assembly robot , called a SCARA robot , which has four degrees of freedom .
A parallel manipulator is a mechanical system that uses several serial manipulator s to support a single platform , or end-effector .
Also known as parallel robots , or generalized Stewart platforms ( in the Stewart platform , the actuators are paired together on both the basis and the platform ) , these systems are articulated robot s that use similar mechanisms for the movement of either the robot on its base , or one or more manipulator arms .
Their ' parallel ' distinction , as opposed to a serial manipulator , is that the end effector ( or ' hand ' ) of this linkage ( or ' arm ' ) is directly connected to its base by a number of ( usually three or six ) separate and independent linkages working simultaneously .
A parallel manipulator is designed so that each chain is usually short , simple and can thus be rigid against unwanted movement , compared to a serial manipulator .
Delta robot s have base-mounted rotary actuator s that move a light , stiff , parallelogram arm .
Two examples of popular parallel robots are the Stewart platform and the Delta robot .

The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is not common , since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation .
This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining : Fisher 's linear discriminant model can only be obtained when the object species are known : class labels and clusters are not necessarily the same .
The following Python code illustrates usage .

In computer science , the maximum sum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum , within a given one-dimensional array A 1 ... n of numbers .
The maximum subarray problem was proposed by Ulf Grenander in 1977 as a simplified model for maximum likelihood estimation of patterns in digitized images .
Maximum subarray problems arise in many fields , such as genomic sequence analysis and computer vision .
In computer vision , maximum-subarray algorithms are used on bitmap images to detect the brightest area in an image .
Thus , the problem can be solved with the following code , expressed here in Python :
Because of the way this algorithm uses optimal substructures ( the maximum subarray ending at each position is calculated in a simple way from a related but smaller and overlapping subproblem : the maximum subarray ending at the previous position ) this algorithm can be viewed as a simple / trivial example of dynamic programming .

The concept of reservoir computing stems from the use of recursive connections within neural network s to create a complex dynamical system .
Two kinds of dynamical system were described : a recurrent neural network with fixed random weights , and a continuous reaction-diffusion system inspired by Alan Turing " s model of morphogenesis .
The extension of the reservoir computing framework towards Deep Learning , with the introduction of Deep Reservoir Computing and of the Deep Echo State Network ( DeepESN ) model allows to develop efficiently trained models for hierarchical processing of temporal data , at the same time enabling the investigation on the inherent role of layered composition in recurrent neural network s .
LSTM was proposed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber .

In theory , classic ( or " vanilla " ) Recurrent neural network can keep track of arbitrary long-term dependencies in the input sequences .
The problem of vanilla RNNs is computational ( or practical ) in nature : when training a vanilla RNN using back-propagation , the gradients which are back-propagated can " vanish " ( that is , they can tend to zero ) or " explode " ( that is , they can tend to infinity ) , because of the computations involved in the process , which use finite-precision numbers .
The activation function of the LSTM " gates " is often the logistic sigmoid function .
The weights of these connections , which need to be learned during Supervised learning , determine how the gates operate .
Peephole Convolutional neural network LSTM .
An RNN using LSTM units can be trained in a supervised fashion , on a set of training sequences , using an optimization algorithm , like gradient descent , combined with backpropagation through time to compute the gradients needed during the optimization process , in order to change each weight of the LSTM network in proportion to the derivative of the error ( at the output layer of the LSTM network ) with respect to corresponding weight .
A problem with using gradient descent for standard RNNs is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events .

Typically , the process starts by terminology extraction and concepts or noun phrase s from plain text using linguistic processors such as part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking .
During the domain terminology extraction step , domain-specific terms are extracted , which are used in the following step ( concept discovery ) to derive concepts .
In the subsequent step , similarly to coreference resolution in information extraction , the OL system determines synonyms , because they share the same meaning and therefore correspond to the same concept .
For example , a maximum entropy rate criterion may be used for feature selection in machine learning .

The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric , but with some alterations .
Where BLEU simply calculates n-gram precision adding equal weight to each one , NIST also calculates how informative a particular n-gram is .
NIST also differs from BLEU in its calculation of the brevity penalty , insofar as small variations in translation length do not impact the overall score as much .
It was originally used for measuring the performance of speech recognition systems , but is also used in the evaluation of machine translation .
As of the early 2000s , several speech recognition ( SR ) software packages exist for Linux .
It is essential to compile a speech corpus to produce acoustic model s for speech recognition projects .

Cambridge , Massachusetts : MIT Press , 1997 , pp. 368 & ndash ; 374. is a cluster analysis algorithm .
It is a variation of k-means clustering where instead of calculating the mean for each cluster to determine its centroid , one instead calculates the median .
This has the effect of minimizing error over all clusters with respect to the 1- norm distance metric , as opposed to the squared 2-norm distance metric ( which k-means clustering does .
The criterion function formulated in this way is sometimes a better criterion than that used in the k-means clustering algorithm , in which the sum of the squared distances is used .

Discriminative models , also referred to as conditional models or backward models , are a class of Supervised learning machine learning used for classification or regression .
This is decided according to the most similar example from the training data ( see supervised learning ) .
Typical discriminative models include logistic regression ( LR ) , support vector machine s ( SVM ) , conditional random fields ( CRFs ) ( specified over an undirected graph ) , decision trees , neural networks , and many others .
Typical generative model approaches include naive Bayes classifier s , Gaussian mixture model s , variational autoencoders and others .
For example , in object recognition , mathx / math is likely to be a vector of raw pixels ( or features extracted from the raw pixels of the image ) .
The equation above represents logistic regression .
It could also be replaced by the Log loss equation below :
Since the Log loss is differentiable , a gradient-based method can be used to optimize the model .
In addition , most discriminative models are inherently supervised learning and cannot easily support unsupervised learning .
During the process of extracting the discriminative features prior to the clustering , Principal component analysis ( PCA ) , though commonly used , is not a necessarily discriminative approach .
Linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) , provides an efficient way of eliminating the disadvantage we list above .

Jaime Guillermo Carbonell ( July 29 , 1953 - February 28 , 2020 ) was a computer scientist who made seminal contributions to the development of natural language processing tools and technologies .
His extensive research in machine translation resulted in the development of several state-of-the-art language translation and artificial intelligence systems .
He earned his B.S. degrees in Physics and in Mathematics from MIT in 1975 and did his Ph.D. under Dr. Roger Schank at Yale University in 1979 .
He was affiliated with the Language Technologies Institute , Computer Science Department , Machine Learning Department , and Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon .
His interests spanned several areas of artificial intelligence , language technologies and machine learning .
In particular , his research focused on areas such as text mining ( extraction , categorization , novelty detection ) and in new theoretical frameworks such as a unified utility-based theory bridging information retrieval , Automatic summarization , free-text Question Answering and related tasks .
He also worked on machine translation , both high-accuracy knowledge-based MT and machine learning for Statistical machine translation ( such as generalized example-based MT ) .
These areas include machine translation , search engines ( including founding of Lycos by Michael Loren Mauldin , one of Carbonell 's PhD students ) , speech synthesis , and education .

The VanÃ­Äek method was then simplified in 1976 by Nicholas R. Lomb of the University of Sydney , who pointed out its close connection to periodogram analysis.ref name = lomb who showed that with minor changes it could be made identical to Lomb 's least-squares formula for fitting individual sinusoid frequencies .
In the VanÃ­Äek method , a discrete data set is approximated by a weighted sum of sinusoids of progressively determined frequencies , using a standard linear regression , or least-squares fit .
The solution for " x " is closed-form , using standard linear regression :
The method defines an optimal solution as the one that minimizes the L1 norm of the coefficients , so that the problem can be cast as a linear programming problem , for which efficient solution methods are available .
The LSSA can be implemented in less than a page of MATLAB code .
In multivariate statistics and the cluster analysis of data , spectral clustering techniques make use of the spectrum ( eigenvalues ) of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering in fewer dimensions .
The general approach to spectral clustering is to use a standard Cluster analysis method ( there are many such methods , " k " -means is discussed below ) on relevant eigenvector s of a Laplacian matrix of mathA / math .

The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines , including : cognitive psychology , evolutionary psychology , cognitive anthropology , artificial intelligence , developmental psychology , and archaeology .
An unrelated but commonly used combination of basic statistics from information retrieval is the F-score , being a ( possibly weighted ) harmonic mean of recall and precision where recall = sensitivity = true positive rate , but specificity and precision are totally different measures .
Kappa statistics such as Fleiss ' kappa and Cohen 's kappa are methods for calculating inter-rater reliability based on different assumptions about the marginal or prior distributions , and are increasingly used as " chance corrected " alternatives to accuracy in other contexts .
When the true prevalence s for the two positive variables are equal as assumed in Fleiss kappa and F-score , that is the number of positive predictions matches the number of positive classes in the dichotomous ( two class ) case , the different kappa and correlation measure collapse to identity with Youden 's J , and recall , precision and F-score are similarly identical with accuracy .
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT , working in Marvin Minsky ' s Artificial Intelligence Lab .

However , usage only became widespread in 2005 when Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs , researchers for the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation ( INRIA ) , presented their supplementary work on HOG descriptors at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( CVPR ) .
HOG descriptors may be used for object recognition by providing them as features to a machine learning algorithm .
Dalal and Triggs used HOG descriptors as features in a support vector machine ( SVM ) ; however , HOG descriptors are not tied to a specific machine learning algorithm .
PCA-SIFT descriptors are similar to SIFT descriptors , but differ in that principal component analysis is applied to the normalized gradient patches .
As for the results , the C-HOG and R-HOG block descriptors perform comparably , with the C-HOG descriptors maintaining a slight advantage in the detection miss rate at fixed false positive rate s across both data sets .
As part of the 2006 European Conference on Computer Vision ( ECCV ) , Dalal and Triggs teamed up with Cordelia Schmid to apply HOG detectors to the problem of human detection in films and videos .
These internal motion histograms use the gradient magnitudes from optical flow fields obtained from two consecutive frames .
At the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in 2006 , Qiang Zhu , Shai Avidan , Mei-Chen Yeh , and Kwang-Ting Cheng presented an algorithm to significantly speed up human detection using HOG descriptor methods .
Their method uses HOG descriptors in combination with the cascading classifiers algorithm normally applied with great success to face detection .
In order to isolate the blocks best suited for human detection , they applied the AdaBoost algorithm to select those blocks to be included in the cascade .
At the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing in 2010 , Rui Hu , Mark Banard , and John Collomosse extended the HOG descriptor for use in sketch based image retrieval ( SBIR ) .

! -- Missing image removed : Caltech 101 vs Caltech 256 on same algorithms --A large problem in comparing computer vision techniques is the fact that most groups use their own data sets .
Model parameters are estimated using an unsupervised learning algorithm , meaning that the visual concept of an object class can be extracted from an unlabeled set of training images , even if that set contains " junk " images or instances of objects from multiple categories .
In this process of vector quantization , one can think of the centroids of these clusters as being representative of the appearance of distinctive object parts .
One-shot learning is an object categorization problem , found mostly in computer vision .
Whereas most machine learning based object categorization algorithms require training on hundreds or thousands of samples / images and very large datasets , one-shot learning aims to learn information about object categories from one , or only a few , training samples / images .

This math \ theta ^ { * } / math is normally estimated using a Maximum Likelihood ( math \ theta ^ { * } = \ theta ^ { ML } / math ) or Maximum A Posteriori ( math \ theta ^ { * } = \ theta ^ { MAP } / math ) procedure .
This dimensionality is reduced using principal component analysis , and math A / math , the appearance parameter , is then formed from the first 10 principal components of each patch .
Another challenge posed by using Internet image search results as training sets for classifiers is that there is a high amount of variability within object categories , when compared with categories found in hand-labeled datasets such as Caltech 101 and Pascal .
, ref name = " fergus " / pLSA ( probabilistic latent semantic analysis ) and extensions of this model were applied to the problem of object categorization from image search. pLSA was originally developed for document classification , but has since been applied to computer vision .
Again , the parameters math \ displaystyle P ( w , x | c , z ) / math and math \ displaystyle P ( d ) / math can be solved using the EM algorithm .

Market basket analysis can be used to cluster analysis .
Several classifications schemes that have been developed use features of the baseband signal that have been used in other audio applications such as speech recognition .
This is done by modeling the received signal then using a statistical estimation method such as maximum likelihood ( ML ) , majority voting ( MV ) or maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) to make a decision about which target in the library best fits the model built using the received signal .
Studies have been done that take audio features used in speech recognition to build automated target recognition systems that will identify targets based on these audio inspired coefficients .
In order for object detection of targets to be automated , a training database needs to be created .
This method uses M blocks of data , extracts the desired features from each ( i.e. LPC coefficients , MFCC ) then models them using a Gaussian mixture model ( GMM ) .
These probabilities are used to determine what the target is using a maximum likelihood decision .
The authors Serge Belongie and Jitendra Malik tested their approach on the MNIST database .

To this end , concepts and technologies from the field of parallelism in computer science are used to enhance and even completely modify the behavior of existing metaheuristics .
Just as it exists a long list of metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithm s , particle swarm , ant colony optimization , simulated annealing , etc. it also exists a large set of different techniques strongly or loosely based in these ones , whose behavior encompasses the multiple parallel execution of algorithm components that cooperate in some way to solve a problem on a given parallel hardware platform .
The initial population is in this case randomly generated ( or created with a greedy algorithm ) ,

In computer science , online machine learning is a method of machine learning in which data becomes available in a sequential order and is used to update the best predictor for future data at each step , as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning on the entire training data set at once .
Online learning algorithms may be prone to catastrophic interference , a problem that can be addressed by incremental learning approaches .
In the setting of supervised learning , a function of math f : X \ to Y / math is to be learned , where mathX / math is thought of as a space of inputs and mathY / math as a space of outputs , that predicts well on instances that are drawn from a joint probability distribution mathp ( x , y ) / math on mathX \ times Y / math .
Mini-batch techniques are used with repeated passing over the training data to obtain optimized out-of-core versions of machine learning algorithms , for example , stochastic gradient descent .
When combined with backpropagation , this is currently the de facto training method for training artificial neural networks .
This method can thus be looked as a greedy algorithm .
One can use the OSD algorithm to derive math O ( \ sqrt { T } ) / math regret bounds for the online version of Support vector machine for classification , which use the hinge loss math v _ t ( w ) = \ max \ { 0 , 1 - y _ t ( w \ cdot x _ t ) \ } / math
The optimal regularization in hindsight can be derived for linear loss functions , this leads to the AdaGrad algorithm .
The first interpretation consider the stochastic gradient descent method as applied to the problem of minimizing the expected risk mathI w / math defined above .
Eugene Goostman is a chatbot that some regard as having passed the Turing test , a test of a computer 's ability to communicate indistinguishably from a human .
In June 2012 , at an event marking what would have been the 100th birthday of the test 's namesake , Alan Turing , Goostman won a competition promoted as the largest-ever Turing test contest , in which it successfully convinced 29 % of its judges that it was human .
On 7 June 2014 , at a contest marking the 60th anniversary of Turing 's death , 33 % of the event 's judges thought that Goostman was human ; the event 's organiser Kevin Warwick considered it to have passed Turing 's test as a result , per Turing 's prediction in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence , that by the year 2000 , machines would be capable of fooling 30 % of human judges after five minutes of questioning .
Eugene Goostman has competed in a number of Turing test competitions , including the Loebner Prize contest ; it finished joint second in the Loebner test in 2001 , On 23 June 2012 , Goostman won a Turing test competition at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes , held to mark the centenary of its namesake , Alan Turing .
On 7 June 2014 , in a Turing test competition at the Royal Society , organised by Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading to mark the 60th anniversary of Turing 's death , Goostman won after 33 % of the judges were convinced that the bot was human .
30 judges took part in the event , which included Lord Sharkey , a sponsor of Turing 's posthumous pardon , artificial intelligence Professor Aaron Sloman , Fellow of the Royal Society Mark Pagel and " Red Dwarf " actor Robert Llewellyn .
Cleverbot 's developer , Rollo Carpenter , argued that Turing tests can only prove that a machine can " imitate " intelligence rather than show actual intelligence .
Gary Marcus was critical of Warwick 's claims , arguing that Goostman 's " success " was only the result of a " cleverly-coded piece of software , " going on to say that " it 's easy to see how an untrained judge might mistake wit for reality , but once you have an understanding of how this sort of system works , the constant misdirection and deflection becomes obvious , even irritating .
Imperial College London professor Murray Shanahan questioned the validity and scientific basis of the test , stating that it was " completely misplaced , and it devalues real Artificial intelligence research .
Mike Masnick , editor of the blog " Techdirt " , was also skeptical , questioning publicity blunders such as the five chatbots being referred to in press releases as " supercomputer s , " and saying that " creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence .

In statistics and data mining , X-means clustering is a variation of k-means clustering that refines cluster assignments by repeatedly attempting subdivision , and keeping the best resulting splits , until a criterion such as the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) or Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) is reached .
For example : The " k " -means model is " almost " a Gaussian mixture model and one can construct a likelihood for the Gaussian mixture model and thus also determine information criterion values .
Rate distortion theory has been applied to choosing " k " called the " jump " method , which determines the number of clusters that maximizes efficiency while minimizing error by Information theory standards .
The distortion of a clustering of some input data is formally defined as follows : Let the data set be modeled as a " p " -dimensional random variable , " X " , consisting of a Gaussian mixture model of " G " components with common covariance , .
One can also use the process of cross-validation to analyze the number of clusters .

Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as language education , lexicography , translation , language planning , which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use , and natural language processing .
Speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interface s to computers .
Applications of computational linguistics in machine translation , computer-assisted translation , and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront .
Nonetheless , semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are literary studies , discourse analysis , text linguistics , and philosophy of language .
Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective .
Translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like Google Translate , which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages .
Computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is " computationally responsible , " i.e. , taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity , so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations .

The edge-preserving filters can conveniently be formulated in a general context of graph-based signal processing , where the graph adjacency matrix is first determined using the differential structure of the image , then the graph Laplacian is formulated ( analogous to the anisotropic diffusion operator ) , and finally the approximate low-pass filter is constructed to amplify the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian corresponding to its smallest eigenvalues .
A repetitive application of the filter may be useful to reduce the noise , leading to the idea of combining the filter with an iterative method , e.g. , the Chebyshev iteration and the conjugate gradient method are proposed in for graph-based image denoising .

In artificial intelligence research , the situated approach builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment .
During the late 1980s , the approach now known as Nouvelle AI ( " Nouvelle " means new in French ) was pioneered at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Rodney Brooks .
As opposed to classical or traditional artificial intelligence , Nouvelle AI purposely avoided the traditional goal of modeling human-level performance , but rather tries to create systems with intelligence at the level of insects , closer to real-world robots .
It was made famous by Rodney Brooks : his subsumption architecture was one of the earliest attempts to describe a mechanism for developing BBAI .
It is extremely popular in robotics and to a lesser extent to implement intelligent virtual agents because it allows the successful creation of real-time dynamic systems that can run in complex environments .
In fact , this approach stems out from early insights of Alan Turing , describing the need to build machines equipped with sense organs to learn directly from the real-world instead of focusing on abstract activities , such as playing chess .
In artificial intelligence and cognitive science , the term situated refers to an agent which is embedded in an environment .
However , learning is obviously key to realistic Artificial general intelligence , so this constraint has been relaxed , though not entirely abandoned .

The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is perhaps the major impediment to solving the word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) problem .
Unsupervised learning methods rely on knowledge about word senses , which is barely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases .
Supervised learning methods depend heavily on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense , a requisite that can be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes , as it is done in the Senseval exercises .
The most direct way of using the Web ( and other corpora ) to enhance WSD performance is the automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora , the fundamental resource to feed Supervised learning WSD algorithms .

In machine learning , multiclass or multinomial classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes .
( Classifying instances into one of two classes is called binary classification .
While some classification algorithms naturally permit the use of more than two classes , others are by nature Binary classification algorithms ; these can , however , be turned into multinomial classifiers by a variety of strategies .
Multiclass classification should not be confused with multi-label classification , where multiple labels are to be predicted for each instance .
One-vs.-restref group = noteIn multi-label classification , OvR is known as " binary relevance " and the prediction of multiple classes is considered a feature , not a problem .
Several algorithms have been developed based on neural networks , decision trees , k-nearest neighbors , naive Bayes , support vector machines and Extreme Learning Machines to address multi-class classification problems .
Naive Bayes is a successful classifier based upon the principle of maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) .
Decision tree learning is a powerful classification technique .
Two very commonly used loss functions are the mean squared error , mathL ( a ) = a ^ 2 / math , and the absolute loss , mathL ( a ) = | a | / math .
It combines the best properties of L2 Mean squared error and L1 absolute loss by being strongly convex when close to the target / minimum and less steep for extreme values .
Given a prediction mathf ( x ) / math ( a real-valued classifier score ) and a true binary classification class label mathy \ in \ { + 1 , -1 \ } / math , the modified Huber loss is defined as
The term math \ max ( 0 , 1 - y \ , f ( x ) ) / math is the hinge loss used by support vector machine s ; the quadratically smoothed hinge loss is a generalization of mathL / math .

Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems , which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models , typically Decision tree learning s .
It is easiest to explain in the least-squares regression setting , where the goal is to " teach " a model mathF / math to predict values of the form math \ hat { y } = F ( x ) / math by minimizing the mean squared error math \ tfrac { 1 } { n } \ sum _ i ( \ hat { y } _ i - y _ i ) ^ 2 / math , where math i / math indexes over some training set of size math n / math of actual values of the output variable mathy / math :
So , gradient boosting is a gradient descent algorithm , and generalizing it entails " plugging in " a different loss and its gradient .
In many supervised learning problems one has an output variable , the goal is to find an approximation math \ hat { F } ( x ) / math to a function mathF ( x ) / math that minimizes the expected value of some specified loss function mathL ( y , F ( x ) ) / math :
It does so by starting with a model , consisting of a constant function mathF _ 0 ( x ) / math , and incrementally expands it in a Greedy algorithm fashion :
In the discrete case however , i.e. when the set math \ mathcal { H } / math is finite , we choose the candidate function may then be calculated with the aid of line search on the above equations .
Gradient boosting is typically used with Decision tree learning ( especially CART trees ) of a fixed size as base learners .
However , it comes at the price of increasing computational time both during training and Information retrieval : lower learning rate requires more iterations .
Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by limiting the minimum number of observations in trees ' terminal nodes ( this parameter is called coden.minobsinnode / code in the R codegbm / code package ) .
Another useful regularization techniques for gradient boosted Decision tree is to penalize model complexity of the learned model.Tianqi Chen .
A popular open-source implementation for R calls it a " Generalized Boosting Model , " however packages expanding this work use BRT .

In the process of translating a text via machine translation , best results may be gained by pre-editing the source textand then post-editing the machine output .
Post-editing involves the correction of machine translation output to ensure that it meets a level of quality negotiated in advance between the client and the post-editor .
Machine translation left the labs to start being used for its actual purpose in the late seventies at some big institutions such as the European Commission and the Pan-American Health Organization , and then , later , at some corporations such as Caterpillar and General Motors .
After the nineties , advances in computer power and connectivity sped machine translation development and allowed for its deployment through the web browser , including as a free , useful adjunct to the main search engines ( Google Translate , Bing Translator , Yahoo ! Babel Fish ) .
With advances in machine translation , this may be changing .
The light / full classification , developed in the nineties when machine translation still came on a CD-ROM , may not suit advances in machine translation at the light post-editing end either .
The quality of machine translation output for post-editing is higher , and therefore requires less post-editing effort , when the machine translation is provided by a neural , vertical or customised machine translation engine .
Translation efficiency gains can be measured by tracking time linguists need to correct the machine translation in the same translation environment , such as XTM Cloud , a Translation management system and Computer-assisted translation tool , where post-editing times and linguistic quality assessment results of the post-edited texts can be compared .

The first three evaluations , Senseval-1 through Senseval-3 , were focused on word sense disambiguation , each time growing in the number of languages offered in the tasks and in the number of participating teams .
From the earliest days , assessing the quality of word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) algorithms had been primarily a matter of intrinsic evaluation , and " almost no attempts had been made to evaluate embedded WSD components .
Senseval-3 looked beyond the lexeme s and started to evaluate systems that looked into wider areas of semantics , such as Semantic Roles ( technically known as Theta roles in formal semantics ) , Logic Form Transformation ( commonly semantics of phrases , clauses or sentences were represented in first-order logic forms ) and Senseval-3 explored performances of semantics analysis on Machine translation .
To facilitate the ease of integrating WSD systems into other Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) applications , such as Machine Translation and multilingual Information Retrieval , the cross-lingual WSD evaluation task was introduced a language-independent and knowledge-lean approach to WSD .
The major tasks in semantic evaluation include the following areas of natural language processing .

Historically , interactive machine translation is born as an evolution of the computer-aided translation paradigm , where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended to work as a tandem .
In this project , the Human-computer interaction was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data-driven machine translation techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors : the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators .
The previously described approaches rely on a tightly coupled underlying corpus-based machine translation system ( usually , a Statistical machine translation system ) that is used as a glass box , therefore inheriting the shortcomings of the translation systems and limiting the usage of interactive machine translation for some scenarios .
Although interactive machine translation is a sub-field of computer-aided translation , the main attractive of the former with respect to the latter is the interactivity .

In statistics and signal processing , step detection ( also known as step smoothing , step filtering , shift detection , jump detection or edge detection ) is the process of finding abrupt changes ( steps , jumps , shifts ) in the mean level of a time series or signal .
Because steps and ( independent ) noise have theoretically infinite bandwidth and so overlap in the Fourier basis , signal processing approaches to step detection generally do not use classical smoothing techniques such as the low pass filter .
When there are only a few unique values of the mean , clustering techniques such as k-means clustering or mean-shift are appropriate .

Before the 21st century the ethics of machines had largely been the subject of science fiction literature , mainly due to computing and artificial intelligence ( AI ) limitations .
Some scholars , such as philosopher Nick Bostrom and AI researcher Stuart J. Russell , argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes " superintelligent , " then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control : just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill , so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence .

Deep learning ( also known as deep structured learning or differential programming ) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning .
Learning can be Supervised learning , Semi-supervised learning or Unsupervised learning .
Deep learning architectures such as deep neural network s , deep belief network s , recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision , automatic speech recognition , natural language processing , audio recognition , social network filtering , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , material inspection and board game programs , where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance .
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithm s that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input .
For example , in image processing , lower layers may identify edges , while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces .
Most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks , specifically , Convolutional Neural Network s ( CNN ) s , although they can also include propositional formula s or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative model s such as the nodes in deep belief network s and deep Boltzmann machine s .
For recurrent neural network s , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once , the CAP depth is potentially unlimited .
Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy algorithm layer-by-layer method .
For supervised learning tasks , deep learning methods eliminate feature engineering , by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to Principal Component Analysis , and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation .
The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions .
The universal approximation theorem for deep neural network s concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow .
Lu et al. proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension , then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension , then deep neural network is not a universal approximator .
Other deep learning working architectures , specifically those built for computer vision , began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980 .
In 1995 , Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train ( over two days ) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm , co-developed with Peter Dayan and Geoffrey Hinton .
Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filter s and support vector machine s ( SVMs ) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s , because of artificial neural network ' s ( ANN ) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks .
Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling .
Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-term memory ( LSTM ) , a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber in 1997 .
In 2006 , publications by Geoffrey Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Yee Whye Teh
Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines , particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) .
Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT ( ASR ) and MNIST database ( image classification ) , as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. but are more successful in computer vision .
In 2010 , researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition , by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision tree s .
In March 2019 , Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing .

The modern version depends on insights drawn from recent research in psychology , linguistics , cognitive science , dynamical systems , artificial intelligence , robotics , animal cognition , plant cognition and neurobiology .
The embodiment movement in artificial intelligence has fueled the embodiment argument in philosophy and a revised view of ethology :
George Lakoff ( a cognitive scientist and linguist ) and his collaborators ( including Mark Johnson , Mark Turner , and Rafael E. NÃºÃ±ez ) have written a series of books promoting and expanding the thesis based on discoveries in cognitive science , such as conceptual metaphor and image schema .
Robotic s researchers such as Rodney Brooks , Hans Moravec and Rolf Pfeifer have argued that true artificial intelligence can only be achieved by machines that have sensory and motor skills and are connected to the world through a body .
The participants were then asked to fill out donations to Haiti for the Red Cross in sealed envelopes .
In the early history of artificial intelligence successes in programming high-level reasoning tasks such as chess-playing led to an unfounded optimism that all AI problems would be relatively quickly solved .
Rodney Brooks argued in the mid-80s that these symbolic approaches were failing because researchers did not appreciate the importance of sensorimotor skills to intelligence in general , and applied these principals to robotics ( an approach he called " Nouvelle AI " ) .
Another successful new direction was neural network s - programs based on the actual structures within human bodies that gave rise to intelligence and learning .
Moravec 's paradox is the discovery by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that , contrary to traditional assumptions , high-level reasoning requires very little computation , but low-level sensorimotor skills require enormous computational resources .
The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec ( whence the name ) and others in the 1980s .
As Hans Moravec writes : blockquote
Many artificial intelligence researchers have argued that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak as well as a human being .
As early as 1950 , Alan Turing wrote : blockquoteIt can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy , and then teach it to understand and speak English .
Embodiment theory was brought into artificial intelligence most notably by Rodney Brooks who showed in the 1980s that robot s could be more effective if they ' thought ' ( planned or processed ) and perceived as little as possible .
In the theory of cluster analysis , the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering .
Many problems in data analysis concern Cluster analysis , grouping data items into clusters of closely related items .
Given this distance between clusters , a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters .
Additionally , it should be the case that all of the clusters produced during the algorithm are the same as the clusters produced by a greedy algorithm that always merges the closest two clusters , even though the greedy algorithm
In machine learning , the hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers .
The hinge loss is used for " maximum-margin " classification , most notably for support vector machine s ( SVMs ) .
While binary SVMs are commonly extended to multiclass classification in a one-vs.-all or one-vs.-one fashion ,
Their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image .

Since the range of values of raw data varies widely , in some machine learning algorithms , objective functions will not work properly without normalization .
Another reason why feature scaling is applied is that gradient descent converges much faster with feature scaling than without it .
This method is widely used for normalization in many machine learning algorithms ( e.g. , support vector machine s , logistic regression , and artificial neural network s ) .
In stochastic gradient descent , feature scaling can sometimes improve the convergence speed of the algorithm .
Diffusion maps is a dimensionality reduction or feature extraction algorithm introduced by Coifman and Lafon which computes a family of embeddings of a data set into Euclidean space ( often low-dimensional ) whose coordinates can be computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data .
Different from linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis ( PCA ) and multi-dimensional scaling ( MDS ) , diffusion maps is part of the family of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods which focus on discovering the underlying manifold that the data has been sampled from .
This is a major difference with methods such as principal component analysis , where correlations between all data points are taken into account at once .

In machine learning , feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data .
Multilayer neural network s can be used to perform feature learning , since they learn a representation of their input at the hidden layer ( s ) which is subsequently used for classification or regression at the output layer .
K-means clustering is an approach for vector quantization .
The problem is computationally NP-hard , although suboptimal greedy algorithm s have been developed .
Principal component analysis ( PCA ) is often used for dimension reduction .
The first step is for " neighbor-preserving , " where each input data point " Xi " is reconstructed as a weighted sum of K-nearest neighbors algorithm data points , and the optimal weights are found by minimizing the average squared reconstruction error ( i.e. , difference between an input point and its reconstruction ) under the constraint that the weights associated with each point sum up to one .
The hierarchical architecture of the biological neural system inspires deep learning architectures for feature learning by stacking multiple layers of learning nodes .
The weights can be trained by maximizing the probability of visible variables using Geoffrey Hinton ' s contrastive divergence ( CD ) algorithm.ref name = Hinton2006 /
The parameters involved in the architecture were originally trained in a Greedy algorithm layer-by-layer manner : after one layer of feature detectors is learned , they are fed up as visible variables for training the corresponding RBM .
Current approaches typically apply end-to-end training with stochastic gradient descent methods .
Considering again the example sentence " " Paris is the capital of France " " , the expected output of an entity linking system will be Paris and France .
Entity linking is beneficial in fields that need to extract abstract representations from text , as it happens in text analysis , recommender system s , semantic search and chatbots .
Word2vec .
Moreover , entity linking has been used to improve the performance of information retrieval systems
Then the best link among the candidates is chosen with a ranking Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) that uses linguistic features .
In the seminal approach of Milne and Witten , supervised learning is employed using the anchor text s of Wikipedia entities as training data.David Milne and Ian H. Witten ( 2008 ) .
Moreover , creating multilingual entity linking systems based on Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) is inherently difficult , as it requires either large text corpora , often absent for many languages , or hand-crafted grammar rules , which are widely different among languages .

In statistics and machine learning , the bias-variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples , and vice versa .
The bias-variance dilemma or bias-variance problem is the conflict in trying to simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training set :
This tradeoff applies to all forms of supervised learning : classification , regression ( function fitting ) ,
We make " as well as possible " precise by measuring the mean squared error between mathy / math and math \ hat { f } ( x ; D ) / math : we want math ( y - \ hat { f } ( x ; D ) ) ^ 2 / math to be minimal , both for mathx _ 1 , \ dots , x _ n / math " and for points outside of our sample " .
Geman et al. argue that the bias-variance dilemma implies that abilities such as generic object recognition cannot be learned from scratch , but require a certain degree of " hard wiring " that is later tuned by experience .

In machine learning , Platt scaling or Platt calibration is a way of transforming the outputs of a classification model into a probability distribution over classes .
Platt scaling works by fitting a logistic regression model to a classifier 's scores .
Consider the problem of binary classification : for inputs , i.e. a classification that not only gives an answer , but also a degree of certainty about the answer .
Platt scaling has been shown to be effective for SVMs as well as other types of classification models , including boosted models and even naive Bayes classifier s , which produce distorted probability distributions .
It is particularly effective for max-margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees , which show sigmoidal distortions in their predicted probabilities , but has less of an effect with well- calibrated models such as logistic regression , multilayer perceptron s , and random forest s .
It uses artificial neural network machine learning methods in its algorithm .
Approached from the regularization perspective , parameter tuning is similar to the scalar-valued case and can generally be accomplished with cross validation .
Training of the network involves a pre-training stage accomplished in a greedy algorithm layer-wise manner , similar to other deep belief networks .

In machine learning , a probabilistic classifier is a classifier that is able to predict , given an observation of an input , a probability distribution over a set of classes , rather than only outputting the most likely class that the observation should belong to .
Some classification models , such as naive Bayes classifier , logistic regression and multilayer perceptron s ( when trained under an appropriate loss function ) are naturally probabilistic .
Other models such as support vector machine s are not , but methods exist to turn them into probabilistic classifiers .
Some models , such as logistic regression , are conditionally trained : they optimize the conditional probability math \ Pr ( Y \ vert X ) / math directly on a training set ( see empirical risk minimization ) .
Other classifiers , such as naive Bayes , are trained generatively : at training time , the class-conditional distribution math \ Pr ( X \ vert Y ) / math and the class prior math \ Pr ( Y ) / math are found , and the conditional distribution math \ Pr ( Y \ vert X ) / math is derived using Bayes ' rule .
Not all classification models are naturally probabilistic , and some that are , notably naive Bayes classifiers , decision tree learning and boosting methods , produce distorted class probability distributions .
For the binary classification case , a common approach is to apply Platt scaling , which learns a logistic regression model on the scores .
In the multiclass classification case , one can use a reduction to binary tasks , followed by univariate calibration with an algorithm as described above and further application of the pairwise coupling algorithm by Hastie and Tibshirani .
Commonly used loss functions for probabilistic classification include log loss and the Brier score between the predicted and the true probability distributions .

Sensitivity or True Positive Rate ( TPR ) , also known as recall , is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive ( True Positive , TP ) of all the people that actually are positive ( Condition Positive , CP = TP + FN ) .
In addition to sensitivity and specificity , the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with positive predictive value ( PPV ) , also known as precision , and negative predictive value ( NPV ) .
Perhaps the simplest statistic is accuracy or Fraction Correct ( FC ) , which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized ; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications : ( TP + TN ) / Total Population = ( TP + TN ) / ( TP + TN + FP + FN ) .
An F-score is a combination of the precision and the recall , providing a single score .
Note , however , that the F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account , and are more suited to information retrieval and information extraction evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable .

It is a symbolic math library , and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks ..
Starting in 2011 , Google Brain built DistBelief as a proprietary machine learning system based on deep learning neural networks .
In May 2016 , Google announced its Tensor processing unit ( TPU ) , an application-specific integrated circuit ( a hardware chip ) built specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow .
TPU is a programmable AI accelerator designed to provide high throughput of low-precision arithmetic ( e.g. , 8-bit ) , and oriented toward using or running models rather than Supervised learning them .
Originally designed to help equip Google employees with practical artificial intelligence and machine learning fundamentals , Google rolled out its free TensorFlow workshops in several cities around the world before finally releasing the course to the public .
TensorFlow provides stable Python ( for version 3.7 across all platforms ) and Swift ( early release ! --version 0.3-- ) .
Among the applications for which TensorFlow is the foundation , are automated image-captioning software , such as DeepDream .
Robotic materials allow to off-load computation inside the material , most notably signal processing that arises during high-bandwidth sensing applications or feedback control that is required by fine-grained distributed actuation .
Beamforming is a signal processing technique used to spatially select propagating waves ( most notably acoustic and electromagnetic waves ) .
The array classes are fully compatible with the array features of MATLAB smallsup ( R ) / sup / small and numpy , including internal storage order , subarray creation , expansion , and advanced indexing .
Higher level functionality is provided by toolboxes for interpolation , optimization , statistics , HDF5 and machine learning .
This deviates from the syntax of Matlab , which are often weakly typed and therefore easier to adopt .
Just like Java - those frameworks are often criticized for not being suitable for numerical computations .
It is characteristic of such programs that they are Unsupervised learning to a degree , learning , for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image - those areas near the camera - than in other portions , those being the areas farthest from the camera .

Roborace is a competition with Autonomous car , electrically powered vehicles .. In 2019 they announced Season Alpha , which would be the first time multiple independent teams would compete against each other .
All teams will utilize the same chassis and powertrain , but will have to develop their own real-time computing algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies .
The world 's first purpose-built autonomous racing car , Robocar , was designed by Daniel Simon , who previously worked on vehicles for movies such as " Tron : Legacy " and " Oblivion " , as well as designing the livery for the 2011 HRT Formula One car .
At the start of the 2017 / 18 Formula E season , the Roborace developers once again tested the DevBot during a public time trial between the Roborace CI and the TV presenter Nicki Shields at the 2017 Hong Kong ePrix .
Two teams are initially competing : Arrival and Technical University of Munich .
In machine learning , Manifold regularization is a technique for using the shape of a dataset to constrain the functions that should be learned on that dataset .
For example , a facial recognition system may not need to classify any possible image , but only the subset of images that contain faces .
Manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semi-supervised learning and transductive learning settings , where unlabeled data are available .
In particular , RLS is designed to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted values and the true labels , subject to regularization .
This can be directly expressed as a linear program , but it is also equivalent to Tikhonov regularization with the hinge loss function , mathV ( f ( x ) , y ) = \ max ( 0 , 1 - yf ( x ) ) / math :

In February 2017 the German Federal Network Agency notified parents that they were obliged to " destroy " any Cayla in their possession as it constitutes a concealed espionage device violating the German Telecommunications Act .
The resulting controversy led to the doll 's inclusion in the Museum of Failure in Sweden , where similar failed products and services which were either commercial failures or are controversial in their own right are on display .
The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible .
This case is strongly related to dimensionality reduction and techniques like principal component analysis which require atoms mathd _ 1 , ... , d _ n / math to be orthogonal .
After applying one of the optimization methods to the value of the dual ( such as Newton 's method or Conjugate gradient method ) we get the value of math \ mathbf { D } / math :
The way to choose an optimal math \ gamma / math in finite sample settings is usually through cross-validation .
Kernel methods ( for instance , support vector machine s or Gaussian process es ) project data points into a high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional feature space and find the optimal splitting hyperplane .
Lots of algorithms can solve machine learning problems using the " kernel matrix " .
The Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative ( DAVI ) is a research and demonstration initiative developing autonomous car s for use on public roads .

AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go .
and AlphaZero .
AlphaGo and its successors use a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously " learned " by machine learning , specifically by an artificial neural network ( a deep learning method ) by extensive training , both from human and computer play .
Starting from a ' blank page ' , with only a short training period , AlphaGo Zero achieved a 100-0 victory against the champion-defeating AlphaGo , while its successor , the self-taught AlphaZero , is currently perceived as the world 's top player in Go as well as possibly in chess .
Almost two decades after IBM 's computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the 1997 match , the strongest Go programs using artificial intelligence techniques only reached about amateur 5-dan level ,
According to DeepMind 's David Silver , the AlphaGo research project was formed around 2014 to test how well a neural network using deep learning can compete at Go .
In a paper released on arXiv on 5 December 2017 , DeepMind claimed that it generalized AlphaGo Zero 's approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm , which achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess , shogi , and Go by defeating world-champion programs , Stockfish , Elmo , and 3-day version of AlphaGo Zero in each case .
As of 2016 , AlphaGo 's algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques , combined with extensive training , both from human and computer play .
It uses Monte Carlo tree search , guided by a " value network " and a " policy network , " both implemented using deep neural network technology .
When compared with Deep Blue or Watson , AlphaGo 's underlying algorithms are potentially more general-purpose and may be evidence that the scientific community is making progress towards artificial general intelligence .
In 2017 , the DeepMind AlphaGo team received the inaugural IJCAI Marvin Minsky medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI .
Toby Manning , the referee of AlphaGo 's match against Fan Hui , and Hajin Lee , secretary general of the International Go Federation , both reason that in the future , Go players will get help from computers to learn what they have done wrong in games and improve their skills .
DeepZenGo , a system developed with support from video-sharing website Dwango and the University of Tokyo , lost 2-1 in November 2016 to Go master Cho Chikun , who holds the record for the largest number of Go title wins in Japan .

Paraphrase or Paraphrasing in computational linguistics is the natural language processing task of detecting and generating paraphrase s .
Applications of paraphrasing are varied including information retrieval , question answering , Automatic summarization , and plagiarism detection .
There has been success in using long short-term memory ( LSTM ) models to generate paraphrases .
The encoder and decoder are trained to take a phrase and reproduce the one-hot distribution of a corresponding paraphrase by minimizing perplexity using simple stochastic gradient descent .
The vector representations of paraphrases should have similar vector representations ; they are processed , then fed as input into a neural network for classification .
Skip-thought vectors are an attempt to create a vector representation of the semantic meaning of a sentence in a similar fashion as the word2vec .
The encoder and decoder can be implemented through the use of a recursive neural network ( RNN ) or an long short-term memory .
Thus a simple logistic regression can be trained to a good performance with the absolute difference and component-wise product of two skip-thought vectors as input .
Since paraphrase recognition can be posed as a classification problem , most standard evaluations metrics such as accuracy , f1 score , or an ROC curve do relatively well .
The evaluation of paraphrase generation has similar difficulties as the evaluation of machine translation .
While originally used to evaluate machine translations , bilingual evaluation understudy ( BLEU ) has been used successfully to evaluate paraphrase generation models as well .

Since their introduction , Transformers have become the basic building block of most state-of-the-art architectures in NLP , replacing gated recurrent neural network models such as the long short-term memory ( LSTM ) in many cases .
This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ) and GPT-2 , which have been trained with huge amounts of general language data prior to being released , and can then be fine-tune trained to specific language tasks .
The primary motivations for the development of the Transformer were to reduce path lengths , thereby making long-range dependencies in sequences easier to learn , and to allow for more parallelization than previous models such as recurrent neural network s and convolutional neural network s ( CNNs ) .
Various architectures of recurrent neural networks have been successful in performing tasks relating to sequences , due to their ability to process inputs of arbitrary length , rather than being restricted to fixed length inputs like those of multilayer perceptron s .
Long short-term memory ( LSTM ) models , a variant of RNNs , attempt to alleviate this issue by choosing very specific operations to perform in the recurrent portion of the network .
Transformers typically undergo semi-supervised learning involving Unsupervised learning pretraining followed by Supervised learning fine-tuning .
The Transformer finds most of its applications in the field of natural language processing ( NLP ) , for example the tasks of machine translation and time series prediction .

LeNet5 was one of the earliest Convolutional neural network and promoted the development of deep learning .
In 1989 , Yann LeCun et al. at Bell Labs first applied the Backpropagation to practical applications , and believed that the ability to learn network generalization could be greatly enhanced by providing constraints from the task 's domain .
Their research continued for the next eight years , and in 1998 , Yann LeCun , Leon Bottou , Yoshua Bengio , and Patrick Haffner reviewed various methods on handwritten character recognition in paper , and used standard handwritten digits to identify benchmark tasks .
When Yann LeCun , et al raised the initial form of LeNet in 1989 .
The LeNet5 means the emergence of Convolutional neural network and defines the basic components of Convolutional neural network .
But it was not popular at that time because of the lack of hardware equipment , especially GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit , a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device ) and other algorithm , such as SVM can achieve similar effects or even exceed the LeNet .
Until the success of AlexNet in 2012 , Convolutional neural network has become the best choice for computer vision applications and many different types of Convolutional neural network has been raised , such as the R- Convolutional neural network series .
Nowadays , Convolutional neural network models are quite different from Lenet , but they are all developed on the basis of Lenet .
In the study of artificial neural network s ( ANNs ) , the neural tangent kernel ( NTK ) is a kernel which describes the evolution of deep learning during their training by gradient descent .
When optimizing the parameters math \ theta \ in \ mathbb { R } ^ { P } / math of an ANN to minimize an empirical loss through gradient descent , the NTK governs the dynamics of the ANN output function mathf _ { \ theta } / math throughout the training .
The NTK can be studied for various ANN architectures , Recurrent neural network ( RNNs ) , Transformer Neural Network s .
In such settings , the large-width limit corresponds to letting the number of parameters grow , while keeping the number of layers fixed : for Convolutional neural network , this amount to letting the number of channels grow .
